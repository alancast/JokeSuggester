Two weeks later, the men of the company return to the facility and open the first room with the two Swiss in it. What they find is just short of unbelievable. The two Swiss had precisely machined 100 pocket watches out of the steel cylinders. All 100 watches had thousands of parts and were in time with one another. The second hands even ticked in unison. The researchers were amazed. They go to the second room where the Germans were left. Upon opening the door, they uncover the two most incredible, painstakingly crafted, precision diesel engines their eyes had ever seen. Both engines were identical in every way. Both engines could run an entire week on one gallon of fuel. The researchers were floored. They can't wait to see what the Kentuckians have is store for them.

So there was this man and woman whom had been married for many years and were still very much in love.  Their anniversary was coming up and the wife wanted to do something very special for her husband and comes up with a wonderful gesture.

She goes to a tattoo parlor and explains to the artist,  ""Every morning, for all the years we've been married, my husband grabs my behind and says 'what beautiful buns you have' so i would like to get a tattoo where is says 'beautiful' on one cheek and 'buns"" on the other"".

The tattoo artist agrees this is a wonderful gesture but says ""unfortunately it will look uneven since you have such small buns"".

Disappointed, the wife finally comes up with an idea, ""well... what if we just but a 'B' on each cheek, it's only for my husband to see and he'll know what it means?""

The artist thinks is a wonderful compromise and proceeds to ink out eloquent B's, one on each cheek.

The wife goes home and is excited to share with her husband.  A couple of days go by and finally it is the night of their anniversary.  After a nice dinner and a little dancing they arrive back home.

""My lovely husband,"" she says, ""because i know how much you love my beautiful buns, i got you something very special for this anniversary.""  
She then turns around, undoes her jeans, slips them down, and bends over to show her husband her amazing gift.

One morning, the pope sleeps through his alarms, and they're 30 minutes late getting on the road to the next stop. The pope is a bit frantic, telling the driver to go faster, but eventually, the driver explains that if he goes any faster, he might lose his license. ""Fine, then I'll drive! What're they gonna do, arrest me?""

So they trade spots, the pope taking the wheel and the driver getting into the back of the limo. 120 miles an hour down the road, and they get pulled over. 

The cop strolls up to the car, taps on the window, and the pope rolls it down, license and registration in hand. The cop sees who it is, apologizes profusely, and sends them on their way.

The next day, the cop's out drinking with friends, and says ""so guess who I pulled over the other day?""

142954,"Real men lay eggs..... ||| Shitfaced and happy, Jack comes home from the pub late one Friday evening. Not wanting to disturb his girl, who's already asleep, he creeps into bed beside her, gives her a peck on her cheek and falls asleep.

When he wakes up, he finds a strange man standing at the end of his bed. To make matters even stranger, the man's wearing a long flowing white robe. 

""Who the hell are you?"" Jack demands, ""and what are you doing in my bedroom?""

With a completely straight face, which unnerves Jack, the mysterious man replies: ""This isn't your bedroom and, fact of the matter is, I'm Lucifer's lieutenant'.

Jack is officially stunned.

""You mean I'm dead?! That can't be, I had so much to live for, I didn't even said goodbye to my family.... you've got to send me back straight away!"" he screams.

The Lieutenant pauses for a while and then replies, ""Yes you can be reincarnated, but you haven't gathered enough karma for me to send you back as a human. The best I can do for you is send you back as a dog or a hen.'

Jack is devastated, but remembers a farm not far from his house. Mulling it over while biting his lip, he finally asks to be sent back as a hen.

A flash of light later and he's covered in feathers, clucking around pecking the ground. 

""Well, this ain't half bad,"" he thinks, until he felt this strange sensation welling up inside him.

Soon enough, the farmyard rooster strolls over and says ""So you're the new hen, yeah? How's your first day here, so far?""

""It ain't so bad!"" Jack the Hen replies, ""but I have this strange feeling inside....like I'm about to explode"".

""That's because you're ovulating,"" explained the rooster, ""don't tell me you've never laid an egg before"".

""Never,"" replies Jack. 

""Well, just relax and let it happen,"" and the rooster walks away.

And so, taking the rooster's advice, Jack submits to the Lord's whims and waits. A few uncomfortable minutes later, an egg pops out from under his tail.

An immense feeling of relief sweeps over Jack, and his emotions got the better of him as he simultaneously experiences relief and motherhood for the first time.

A few seconds later, when he's laying his second egg, the feeling of happiness becomes so overwhelming, he knows that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing to have ever happened to him.....

His joy knows no bounds by now, and he's just about to lay his third egg,  when he feels an enormous smack on the back of his head. He looks around and there's no one there, so he lets it go, concentrating on becoming a mother for the third time.

Another smack and this time, he hears his girlfriend's voice, calling out in the distance. 

Jack looks up, the egg's crown just about to pop through his mother-hole, and this time he hears her clearly:

When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and asked him what the government was.
 

His dad thought for a while and answered, ''Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.''


''I still don't get it'' responded Little Johnny.


''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.

''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny as he went off to bed. 

In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. 

When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. 

When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. 

Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government!

/u/Unidan, /u/Sojoez, and /u/AWildSketchAppeared.


Inside the jungle they are captured by a tribe of natives. The tribe does not take kindly to strangers but they are offered a challenge.  
They are to go into the jungle and return at the end of the day with a fruit.  
If the fruit is unknown to the natives they go free. However! If the natives do know the fruit, it will be inserted into their ass. If they make any noise at all, they will be executed, but if they withstand it, they go free.


First to return is Unidan, he is carrying a round, hard fruit that most people would not look twice at. Before he can explain what it is, the natives say: ""Ah yes, the [wood-apple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonia_acidissima) we make jam out of those. Bend over!"" As the fruit gets inserted unlubed and stem first, Unidan screams and gets his throat slit.


Sojoez figures that the natives have been living here for centuries and that the jungle knows no secrets to them, so he grabs 3 [cranberries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry) and returns to the village. The natives recognize the fruit and tell him to bend over. As the first two get inserted nothing happens, but at the third, Sojoez breaks into a laughing fit and also gets his throat slit.


Somewhere in the afterlife, Unidan confronts Sojoez and asks: ""Why did you laugh? You where almost free to go.""

The coach had put together the perfect team for the Chicago Bears. The only thing that was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a thrower who could ensure a Super Bowl win.
 
Then, one night while watching Fox News he saw a war-zone scene in the West Bank. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Israeli soldier with  a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away.
KABOOM!
 
He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a      chimney.
KA-BLOOEY!
 
Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph.
 BULLS-EYE!
 
""I've got to get this guy!"" Coach said to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!""
 
So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football.
And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl.
 
The young man is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.
 
""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl!""
 
""I don't want to talk to you, the old woman says."" You are not my son!""
 
""I don't think you understand, Mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""
 
""No! Let me tell you!"" his mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!"" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says,
