You’d be hard pressed to find something in music/culture that Bowie hasnt influenced. His stature cannot overstated. He will be missed. RIP.,2016-01-11 09:58:12,280,69,en
Bowie gave anyone different permission to be themselves. Im a straight white dude and he freed me. Cant imagine what he meant to gay/bi kids,2016-01-11 09:56:25,533,181,en
Listen to LOW or HEROES. Or STATION TO STATION. Or HUNKY DORY. Or SCARY MONSTERS. Or HEATHEN. Or ZIGGY. Perfection from start to finish. RIP,2016-01-11 09:43:25,327,78,en

Bowie left behind a ton of perfect music and a roadmap on how to challenge yourself in whatever you do/make. He was and is the greatest. RIP,2016-01-11 09:33:38,432,155,en
"When Bowie had some juice he instantly paid tribute to and helped his heroes: Iggy, Lou, Mott the Hoople. Making the world even better. RIP.",2016-01-11 09:29:47,255,62,en
Nobody set the pace like Bowie. The Berlin trilogy and Scary Monsters set the tone for so much of what we love. A true titan. RIP.,2016-01-11 09:27:52,160,20,en
The changes he undertook were the definition of courage. Going from DIAMOND DOGS to YOUNG AMERICANS? Unthinkably brave. RIP.,2016-01-11 09:26:31,163,27,en
"Bowie was a one-man Beatles. He put together a ten year stretch of perfect albums, each changing and elevating the artform. A true hero. RIP",2016-01-11 09:24:49,403,153,en
