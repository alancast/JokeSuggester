Yenoram,"The preacher is on his deathbed ||| As an old preacher lay dying, he issued his last request. He requested the presence of two of his congregants, a banker and a lawyer.

When they arrived, they were ushered up to his room. As they entered, the old preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. The preacher grasped their hands, smiled contentedly, and for a time said nothing.

Finally, the lawyer broke the silence by asking the preacher why he'd asked them to come. To which he replied, ""Jesus died between two thieves, so that's how I wanna go.""",6,2016-01-01

The anvil falls so far that the hunters don't hear it hit the bottom but then they see a goat sprinting past them and jump into the hole. They stand by the hole thinking about what just happened until a farmer comes along. The farmer says ""Have you seen my goat Becky?"" The hunters reply, ""Yeah, it ran passed us and jumped into that hole."" The farmer says, ""That's impossible. She couldn't have done that, she was chained to an anvil."" ",518,2016-01-01

yeahmaybe2,"Biker Kisses ||| Back on September 9th, a group of Peking, Illinois bikers were riding west on I-74 when they saw a girl about to jump off the Murray Baker Bridge. So they stopped.

George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says, ""Hey Baby, whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?""

She says tearfully, ""I'm going to commit suicide!!""
While he didn't want to appear 'sensitive', George also didn't want to miss this 'be-a-legend' opportunity either so he asked, ""Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe, why don't you give ole George here your best last kiss?""

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that. And it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.

After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, ""Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had, Honey! That's a real talent you're wasting, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why the hell are you committing suicide?""

""My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl.""

It's still unclear whether she fell, jumped or was pushed.
