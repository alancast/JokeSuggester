AnticitizenPrime,"The Brass Rat ||| A man, visiting San Francisco, noticed a musty curio shop, which seemed to be forgotten by time. It seemed very out of place in the busy city. The man's curiosity was piqued, and he entered the shop. The store didn't seem to have much traffic, and the shelves were full of dusty, but interesting items. The man found himself strangely interested in a rather ugly brass rat on a shelf behind the counter. Ugly it was, but he had never seen anything like it -- it was so incredibly detailed, and life-like. He asked the shopkeeper for a price.

The man was pleased to learn that he could acquire the rat for only $5, and he handed the shopkeeper the money. But, before giving the man the rat, the shopkeeper sternly warned him, ""This sale is final. If you leave the shop with the brass rat, I won't take it back under any circumstances.""

The man thought the warning was curious, given that the rat only cost $5. Even if he decided he hated the rat, that was hardly an amount worth worrying about. He agreed to the shopkeeper's terms, and left with the rat.

At first, everything seemed perfectly normal. But as he walked back toward his car, the man started to hear strange rustling noises around him. Then he saw a life rat scurry out of an alley, and start to follow him. Suddenly, rats seemed to be appearing all around him, streaming out of sewers and dumpsters, all following him and milling about his feet.

The man began to run, but the rats kept up in increasing numbers. The man realized that he was being chased by literally tens of thousands of rats. The ground came alive, as the rats swarmed behind him.

The man suddenly realized the significance of the shopkeeper's warning, and knew what he had to do. He turned toward the bay, and ran as quickly as he could toward the water.

zoplik90,"A train conductor was conducting his train... ||| when he derailed it and the train suffered a terrible crash. Only those in the front of the train survived. He was put on trial for the murder of nearly a hundred people. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the electric chair.

When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened to the conductor. The prison guard was shocked and, not knowing what to do, simply let him go unscathed. 

In a few days, the conductor was back to work. A few days after his return to the train business, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was trialed and found guilty of mass murder. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.

It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see the conductor again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him.
""What would you like for your last meal, sir?"" The conductor respond as he did last time: ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

The electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go.

The conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people.

He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.

The prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.

The man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, ""Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?"" The conductor responds with: ""No, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.""",478,2015-06-07

Fast forward to about 16 years later:

One day the woman was in her bedroom folding laundry when all of a sudden one of her daughters runs into the room crying profusely. 

""What happened??"" asked the mother.

The daughter replied, ""Well I was peeing and all of a sudden I felt a lot of pressure and then a bullet came out.""

The mother thought for a moment, shocked, and then replied, ""Well honey, I'm almost done folding laundry so as soon as I'm done I'll take you into the doctor.""

The daughter walked out as the mother continued to fold her laundry when all of a sudden her second daughter walks into the room bawling her eyes out, ""Mom! Mom! Something horrible just happened! I was peeing and a bullet came out!""

Now the mother was very confused. ""Well I'll take you and your sister to the emergency room in just a moment, I only have a few more shirts to fold.""

The second daughter left the room as the mother continued to fold the laundry. As she gets to the last shirt her son busts into the room, laughing so hard that he is nearly in tears. The son then says, ""Mom, you'll never guess what just happened to me.""

The mother replies, ""What, were you peeing and a bullet came out?""

The son then answered, ""No, I was jerking off and I shot the dog!""",16,2015-06-07

After about an hour and no interest from other patrons she looks back at the bar and sees the same man sitting alone drinking a beer. The woman walks to him and says ""okay, I'll bite, what makes that beer so magic."" The man stands up, takes a huge gulp, jumps out the window and flys around the builiding and back through the window. The woman is amazed and demands he do it again, so he does. She tells him if he does it again she'll try it too. So he again takes a huge gulp, and preforms his trick. 

After seeing this she immediately takes the beer - down it, and jumps out the window and falls 18 floors to her death.

I've suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.""

I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?

I once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.

Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my motorcycle that I noticed a small amount of motor oil leaking through the gasket between the rear head and rocker arm cover.

Earlier this year, a Chinese family moved into my small town. The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, a short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.


""Don't stop, be Lee, Ving. Hold on the that fee, Ling""",85,2015-06-08

A week later, they get to the park and unwrap their hamper and realize they've forgotten the salad dressing. They plead with Uncle tortoise to go back for it.

""No way, it'll take me two weeks to get there and back! You'll start the food without me and it'll be gone when I'm back!"" he says.

After assuring him they won't touch the food until he returns, he goes off on his way. 2 weeks later and the Tortoise family are getting hungry but there's no sign of Uncle Tortoise.

""I'm sure he'll be here soon, we promised we wouldn't start without him"" says Momma Tortoise

Another week goes by and he's still not come back. By now the Tortoise family is starving.

""We're all hungry but we promised so we'll have to wait I'm afraid"" says Momma Tortoise.

The second blonde enjoys the idea, but mentions she can't leave also to go in search for a bull for financial reasons, having to save up  money to be able to purchase the farm. However, she gives the first blonde $500 dollars to buy the bull, confident it will be enough money.

So the first blonde sets off for the country and happens upon a farm selling exactly what she is looking for.

She asks the nice woman how much the bull will cost and the woman says, ""$499, final offer.""

Ecstatic, the blonde hands over the $500 and is returned $1 exactly. 

She realizes that having a bull in tow, on route home, would prove more difficult than traveling alone to the country. This was a time before cell phones and she was at a loss of what to do.

She manages to find a post office and wants to send her fellow blonde a letter. She asks how much a letter to the city would be, and the clerk says, ""It's free but I charge a dollar a word, sweety.""

""I love it!"" says the actor. ""When's the audition?""

""Wednesday,"" says the agent.

Wednesday comes and the actor arrives at the audition. He marches on stage and shouts, ""Hark, I hear the cannons roar!""

""Brilliant!"" says the director, ""you've got the job! The first show is at 9 o'clock, Saturday night.""

The actor is so excited that he goes on a major bender. He wakes up 8:30 Saturday evening and runs to the theater, continually repeating his line, ""Hark, I hear the cannons roar! Hark, I hear the cannons roar!""
He arrives and is stopped by the bouncer.

the rest.  He checks the gauges and sees that it's 90 degrees and about 80% humidity.  So he goes over to the farmer and asks why he's so happy.


The farmer says, ""I like it here.  The temperature is just like plowing my

The Devil isn't happy with the farmer's answer and decides to get him, so
he goes over and turns up the temperature to 100 degrees and the humidity to 90%.  After turning everything up he goes looking for the farmer.  He finds him standing around just as happy as can be.  The Devil quizzes the farmer again as to why he's so happy.


The farmer says, ""This is even better. It's like pulling weeds in the
fields during July.""


The Devil, now upset, decides to really make the farmer suffer.  He goes
over to the controls and turns the heat up to 120 degrees and the humidity
to 100%.


""Now lets see what the farmer is up to,"" he says.  So he goes looking for
the farmer.  He finds him sitting on the floor even happier then before.
The Devil can't figure it out.  He asks the  farmer why he's happy now.


The farmer replies, ""This is great, it's just like working in the silo with
my friends in August.""


The Devil says, ""That's it, I'll get this farmer.""  He goes over and turns
the temperature down to a freezing 25 degrees.  ""Let's see what the farmer
has to say about this.""


The Devil looks around and finds the farmer jumping up and down for joy and

Being a pompous dick and not wanting to talk to a lowly old man riding a scooter, the business man flips him off, and rolls up the window.  He then decides, I am gonna show this old man how awesome me and my car really is.  As soon as the light goes green the business man floors the Ferrari attempting to leave him in the dust.  As he takes off the he looks in his rear view mirror and to his amazement he can see the old man on the scooter not far behind and gaining on him.  Not to be made a fool of the business man gives it all he's got accelerating to 100 mph.   He looks in his mirror again expecting the old man to be left behind but to his utter amazement the old man is still close behind and gaining!!

The pair finally come to a stop and the business man rolls his window back down, ""sir I want to apologize for my behavior back there, I shouldn't have flipped you off and thought so poorly about you and your scooter.  You obviously have a good scooter that is just as amazing as my awesome car.""

The young man politely asked the rabbi if he wanted some more hot soup. The rabbi nodded his head and tok another plate of hot soup. He turned to the dog and asked him if he wanted a little taste. The dog nodded his head and took a big gulp of the soup. The rabbi started eating what was left and said to the young man ""So... young one. What is your profession?"". The young man pushed back his chair, stood up and replied ""I am a mason and damn proud of it!"". The rabbi gave a condescending shrug and went back to finishing his soup. Just as the soup was finished a young, pretty woman came in the door. She looked a bit pale and the rabbi asked her ""Good day young lady. What seems to be the problem?"". The young lady stumbled somewhat and whispered ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I was not expecting a rabbi and a dog in here"". To which the rabbi quickly replied ""Oh, do not be afraid. I'm just a humble rabbi. I mean you no harm, As for the dog, you would have to ask him yourself."". The dog sat up and gave the girl his attention. ""Hello, dog. What are you here then?"" the woman asked. The rabbi started laughing ""Hehehe, young lady. This is a dog. He cannot speak! Tell me. What is your profession?"". The young lady pulled out a chair, firmly sat down and loudly proclaimed ""Me?! I'm a hooker!"". The man, the dog and the rabbi. all jumped in their seats with shock. To avoid the awkward silence, the man quickly asked ""soo... how much do you make doing... that?"", realising he just made the situation much worse. He quickly followed up by offering her some hot soup to which she kindly agreed. Midday turned into evening and soon everyone got along. The young man had been wondering about this for some time now, so he decided to ask the rabbi ""So, mr rabbi, sir. Have you always been a rabbi. What was your profession before becoming a rabbi?"".

A cruise ship hired a magician to entertain the passengers. Since the passengers changed every four or five days, the magician was able to perform the same tricks over and over. 

Unfortunately, the Captain of the ship had a parrot who sat around and watched the magician perform his tricks, over and over. Eventually, the parrot learned how the tricks were done and would interrupt the act. 

""It's in his sleeve,"" the parrot would say. ""He switched balls."" ""It's in his pocket."" Etc., etc. 

Naturally, the magician was quite disturbed by the parrot but could do nothing about it, since it belonged to the Captain. 

Unfortunately, the cruise ship had the misfortune of hitting an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the sea in a matter of minutes. As fate would have it, the magician and the parrot managed to grab hold of the same floating piece of furniture. 

For 3 days, neither said anything. The magician stared at the parrot and the parrot stared back. Finally, on the 4th day, the parrot cracked and said, ""OK, I give up, where on Earth did you put the ship?""

After supper, they were relaxing in the hotel restaurant, talking.  The Catholic priest said, ""You know, it's great to get to know one
another's theology across sectarian boundaries like this.  But I think it would be even better if we shared some of our human side.  Don't any of you have any bad habits?  You know, confession is good for the soul, and we'd surely build mutual tolerance, knowing what faults we all share.  How about it?""
The Baptist minister said, ""I'd have to say that that's a fine idea.
I've been carrying a burden for a long time, and I'd be glad to finally get it off my heart.  You see, friends, I'm a terrible, terrible
drunkard.  I've got a flask in every jacket and gown I have.

The Episcopalian rector nodded gravely and said.  ""Well, that can't
be worse than me.  I'm a terrible, terrible adulterer.  I'm completely out of control!  If a woman in my parish can fog a mirror, I'll come on to her.  I've got the back door keys to every house in my congregation, and my office couch folds out into a bed.  I don't even like to have my picture taken with the children's Sunday school classes!""
The Methodist minister heaved a sigh, and said, ""I'm afraid I've got that beat.  I'm a terrible, terrible embezzler.  I'm no good with money; and I've got a taste for high living that my salary can't satisfy.  Each church I've served at could have paid down their mortgage like you wouldn't believe if not for me and my VISA bill.  What a hypocrite I've been, brow-beating my hard-working parishioners to pledge more each year, while I spent their gifts hand over fist!""
The Catholic priest steepled his fingers and bowed his head.  He said nothing.  Presently one of the others said, ""Well?  Don't you have any skeletons to share?""
The priest shrugged and looked up.  ""Well, I'm a terrible, terrible

He went to his local parlor and explained his idea, and the tattoo artist said ""I've done this before, you'll need to become erect.""

As the guy is peeing, he looks over and sees the midget with the biggest cock ever.  The midget catches the guy staring and the guy turns away.  Seconds later, the guy starts to gaze at the huge member of the midget and the midget catches him again.

""Sorry.  It's just that...that your dick is huge.  I mean, it's probably 14-15 inches long.  I've never seen anything like it.""

 However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. 
 By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. 
 MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if 
 There was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills Versus car kills. 
 He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat road Kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to Warn of impending danger. 
 They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""

This was a missing child, presumably abducted, so it was even worse. There was a plea from the mother, and the wording stuck with me; she said the day and the place she was last seen, and then all she said was “she has blonde hair, blue eyes, and is always happy, please help me”. It stayed with me. I met up with some mates in London the next weekend and stumbled upon an alleyway on our way home. Somebody was living in this little area in the corner, and I could see a little mattress with a little girl, with her hands tied. I started getting really nervous, remembering the news, and tried to remember what the mum said… 

Blonde hair? Blonde hair. 

Blue eyes? Blue eyes. 

Always happy? Crying her eyes out. 

Definitely wasn’t her.

He decided to get a tattoo on his penis of his wife's name, Wendy. So he goes down to the tattoo parlor and gets a big WENDY in all capitol letters down the length of his shaft. He goes home, and his wife loves it.

Our hero is a grower, not a shower, so when he's not erect you can't see the whole name, unfortunately. You can only really make out the W on his head and the Y down and the base, so unless he's hard his penis doesn't so much say WENDY as it says WY.

Months later, he finds himself on a business trip to Jamaica. In the airport in Kingston, he rushes to a urinal to relieve himself.

A local comes up beside him to the only other urinal there. Quickly glancing at his new neighbor, the man notices a similar WY tattoo on the Jamaican man's junk.

Curiosity gets the better of him, and he decides to ask the local about their similar tattoos.

""I'm terribly sorry, but I couldn't help but notice we have a similar tattoo.""

""Well, I noticed the WY on your penis. I have something similar, it's my wife's name, WENDY. I was just curious, does your wife's name happen to be Wendy, too?""

Then the women were told to exchange phones and read the responding text messages.   
    
Here are some of the replies:   
    
I. Eh, mother of my children, are you sick?   
    
II. What now? Did you crash the car again?   
    
III. I don't understand what you mean?  
    
IV. What did you do now? I won't forgive you this time!!!  
    
V. ?!?   
    
VI. Don't beat about the bush, just tell me how much you need?   
    
VII. Am I dreaming?  
    
VIII. If you don't tell me who this message is actually for, you will die today...!!!

Ori15n,"The three tortures. ||| A tourist got lost hiking in some mountains in China. It started snowing so he decided to seek shelter. He came upon a tall tower with light in the window, so he pounded on the door. A little old Chinese man opened the door.

""WHAT YOU WAN' ROUND EYE""

Shocked that the old man spoke english, the traveler told him about his dilemma and through some slight coaxing, was invited inside. The old man and his daughter were sitting down to eat. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. The old man saw the traveler staring and whacked him with a spoon.

""YOU MAY BE GUEST, BUT YOU SEX MY DAUGHTER I GIVE YOU THE THREE ANCIENT TORTURE""

The traveler promised not to even glance at the girl. And off to bed he went in the guest room at the very top of the tower. Low and behold, 4 hours later the daughter was crawling into bed with him. ""What the hell"" he thought. And they made passionate love.

The next morning the traveler woke up with a heavy feeling on his chest. He opened his eyes and saw a rock with a not on it. ""TORTURE 1: ROCK ON CHEST"". The traveler laughed. the stupid old man calls THIS torture? He would gladly take on these three tortures if they were all this silly. So he stood up and decided to throw the rock out the window, as it was heavy and he didn't want to carry it down stairs. Or leave it in the room and leave in shame.

Out the window the rock went. The traveler then felt something odd. Something was crawling up his thigh...
He noticed another note dragging across the floor, attached to some thin piano wire, towards him. The not said in large, bold print,  ""TORTURE 2: LEFT TESTICLE TIED TO ROCK""

Thinking quickly the traveler jumped out the window. Broken bones sounded better than castration. While falling he saw the old man grinning in the courtyard below. He held a sign over his head that read ""TORTURE 3: RIGHT TESTICLE TIED TO BED POST"". ",112,2015-06-10

doomsdaydefense,"So I was filling up at the gas station the other day.. ||| ... and a young man pulled up in front of me in one of those old, built-like-a-tank F-150's. Now this young man had what I would call a trailer-park demeanor. He looked from side to side as he approached the pump, spitting chew out onto the ground as he wiped his trucker cap across the shoulder of a ratty t-shirt. He looked back at me once with a big evil grin, showing yellow teeth and a scar on his upper lip. 

He looked back at the pump and started to mutter some nonsense in hillbilly-NASCAR speak; apparently he did not find the price of gasoline agreeable. Cursing to himself, the young man began to fill up his tank with gas. All the while, this man continued to speak to himself under his breath - it was at this point that I transitioned from curious to worried, as even the normal words this man was using made little sense when put together. Needless to say, I had gotten the slowest pump and was going nowhere until it finished glugging the gas into my car.

The young redneck was more fortunate than I or just cheaper, and reached to pull out the gas handle - unfortunately, he failed to release the trigger on the handle, and gasoline came spilling out all over the side of his truck and the redneck himself. 

The cussing began in earnest at this point. He yelled a loud ""FUCK THIS HERE KAMA-SUTRA BULLSHIT"", which I still don't know the meaning of, save that this man was angry. The redneck marched away from the pump and into the convenience store, where he appeared to belligerently berate the poor Pakistani attendant. This went on for some time, and I had finally finished pumping my gas when the redneck returned in vitriolic fashion to his truck, swearing again under his breath; this time about some Ay-Rab Jew mongrel and something about hooker tits. 

Feeling that the best of the show was over, I finally got in my car to leave. Just as I buckled up, I noticed that the redneck had lit a cigarette next to his truck. I quickly fumbled for my keys - I was not going to be brought to the gates of hell alongside this moron, and sure enough the young man flicked his cigarette on the ground.

The flame lashed up his gas-stained jeans and shirt as soon as the ember touched the soiled concrete. He had not spilled much on his clothes; the majority of the gas had apparently spilled onto his arm and hand. The man raised his arm in terror, shrieking as it was fully engulfed in flame. I was frozen in shock, and before I could recover from my cowardice a police officer raced passed my car and dragged the man away from the gas pumps. He quickly made the man roll on the ground and the fire was out before it could spread to the man's face, or worse, the rest of us in the gas station parking lot.

The officer walked over to me and several other witnesses, and he asked us to stick around to give a testimony over what happened. I did so, and told him just what I've said here - minus the mongrel and hooker tits stuff. 

The officer released us and I was just about to go when I saw that he was writing the redneck a ticket. I have to admit - I was curious. I politely walked back up to the officer and asked, ""Excuse me sir, it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but notice that you were writing this man a ticket. Given that he just went through a such a terrifying experience, do you mind me asking what he did to deserve a ticket?""

The officer apparently didn't mind me asking at all. ""I don't like to do it son, but the law is the law. You can't just go around anywhere waving a firearm.""

Transphobia is ethimologically the term of having an irrational fear of transgender people, but is widly used to caracterise all discrimination of transgender people. To understand it, we need to first understand who are trans people.


**First part : Who are transgender people.**


To understand that transgender have the same right and be treated as equals, it is first important to understand who they are and not just limit oneself to the clichés that are propaged by our popular culture : Transgender actually cover many situation related to one's gender identity or gender expression. While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. 


Transsexual people identify as a member of the sex opposite to that assigned at birth, and desire to live and be accepted as such
Transsexual people may undergo gender transition, the process of aligning one's gender expression or presentation with their internal gender identity. People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer, but simply as a man or a woman. Those who continue identifying as transsexual men or women may not want to ignore their pre-transition life, and may continue strong ties with other trans people and raising social consciousness.
The process of transition may involve some kind of medical gender reassignment therapy and often (but not always) includes hormone replacement therapy or sex reassignment surgery. References to ""pre-operative"", ""post-operative"" and ""non-operative"" transsexual people indicate whether they have had, or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery, although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity.


*Transvestite or cross-dresser*


A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes of the opposite sex The term ""transvestite"" is used as a synonym for the term ""cross-dresser"", although ""cross-dresser"" is generally considered the preferred term. The term 'cross-dresser' is not exactly defined in the relevant literature. Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, offers this definition: ""[A cross-dresser] is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex, but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of the opposite sex."" This definition excludes people ""who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons,"" such as ""those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers."" Cross-dressers may not identify with, or want to be the opposite gender, nor adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender, and generally do not want to change their bodies medically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as heterosexual People who cross-dress in public can have a desire to pass as the opposite gender, so as not to be detected as a cross-dresser, or may be indifferent.
The term ""transvestite"" and the associated outdated term ""transvestism"" are conceptually different from the term ""transvestic fetishism"", as ""transvestic fetishist"" describes those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes. In medical terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by use of the separate codes


*Genderqueer*


Genderqueer is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts, and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations. One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male, sometimes female, but whose gender identity is female, gender expression is butch, and sexual orientation is lesbian. It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes, conjoining both gender and sexuality,[55] and challenges existing constructions and identities.[56] In the binary sex/gender system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.


*Androgyne*


An androgyne is a person who cannot be classified into the typical gender roles of their society; androgyny is independent of orientation. Androgynes may identify as beyond gender, between genders, moving across genders, entirely genderless, or any or all of these, exhibiting a variety of male, female, and other characteristics. Androgyne identities include pangender, ambigender, non-gendered, agender, gender fluid or intergender. Androgyny can be either physical or psychological and is independent of birth sex. Occasionally, non-androgynous people adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous. This outward androgyny has been used in fashion, and the milder forms of it (women wearing men's pants or men wearing two earrings, for example) are not seen as transgender behavior.
The term androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex individual.


*Bigender*


A bigender (sometimes rendered as bi-gender, dual gender, or bi+gender) individual is one who moves between masculine and feminine gender roles. Such individuals fluidly move between two distinct personalities depending on context: whereas androgynous people retain the same gender-typed behaviour across situations, bigendered people consciously or unconsciously change their gender-role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine or vice versa.
Drag kings and queens
Drag is a term applied to clothing and make-up worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the terms drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community, have embraced the pornographically-derived term tranny to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing, however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people.


**Second part  : Why the hate.**


The mechanisms of Transphobia are still debated :

The transfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues in her book Whipping Girl that transphobia is rooted in sexism. She locates the origins of both transphobia and homophobia in what she calls ""oppositional sexism"", the belief that male and female are ""rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires"". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with ""traditional sexism"", the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.



The transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary. Norton writes that the ""male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends""


For my part, i think it is the same phenomen that all form of discrimination and that people just fear and hate what they resent as not being identical to what they were accustomed to. But whatever is the phenomen, the consequences are what really matter.


**The result : Discrimination**

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to transphobia or homophobia, is a common occurrence for trans people. Every 3 days a murder of a trans person is reported, and many murders are believed to go unreported. Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and ""in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims.

One of the most famous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a young trans man who was raped and murdered by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth. The events became internationally known when told in the feature film Boys Don't Cry, which earned Hilary Swank an Academy Award for best actress.

The fact is that people with unclear gender identity ressent exclusion and discrimination which can affect their well being and social condition, which is why i am writting this essay (or more precisely, pasting it from wikipedia), which you should understand by now is the actual joke related to the late planetside ban affair in which the banned had to write an essay to be unbanned, and you actually didnt have to read all this to catch.",0,2015-06-10

At the restaurant, the boy and the girl had to wait in a line much longer than the line at the cafeteria. They became closer from this, laughing about how often they spend their time waiting in lines. Finally they are seated and enjoy their meal.
A month later, the couple go to the school prom, ironically the boy had to wait in a 30 minutes in a line for the flowers, 45 minutes in a line for the tux, and an hour in the bathroom! Tired from all of this waiting in lines, he is excited to spend some time with the girl at the dance.
Many people go to this school, so the line to get into prom was long itself, which really didn't bother the couple, since they were so used to the long lines anyway, they made it fun.
Finally after all this time the couple are at the prom and begin dancing the night away. After a while, the two are very tired from dancing, and sit down for a little bit to take a break.

While suffering the agonies of impending death, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favourite cheese scones wafting up the stairs. He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed. Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom and, with even greater effort, gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled downstairs. 

With laboured breath, he leaned against the doorframe, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for deaths agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven, for there, spread out upon the waxed paper of the the kitchen table, were dozens of his favourite scones. 

Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted Irish wife of sixty years, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?

Mustering one great effort, he threw himself towards the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted. He could almost taste the cheese scone before it was in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to the nearest scone at the edge of the table, when his hand was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife...

The Swede`s wife steps up to the tee and, as she bends over to place her ball, a gust of wind blows her skirt up and reveals her lack of underwear. 

'Good God, woman! Why aren't you wearing any skivvies?', Ole demanded. 

'Well, you don't give me enough housekeeping money to afford any.' 

The Swede immediately reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 50. Go and buy yourself some underwear. 

Next, the Irishman's wife bends over to set her ball on the tee. Her skirt also blows up to show that she, too, is wearing no undies. 

'Blessed Virgin Mary, woman! You've no knickers. Why not?' 

She replies, 'I can't afford any on the money you give me.' 

Patrick reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 20. Go and buy yourself some underwear!' 


Lastly, the Scotsman's wife bends over. The wind also takes her skirt over her head to reveal that she, too, is naked under it. 

'Sweet mudder of Jaysus, Aggie! Where ta friggin hell are yer drawers?'

All of the jokes were going great-- ""three ethnics walked into a bar...""; ""an American, a Canadian and an ethnic were on a plane..."" Etc etc.

Confused, the man asks, ""So, why is everything in order and so clean, and  breakfast is on the table waiting for me?  I should expect a big quarrel with her!""  His son replies, ""Oh, that!

desiwalterwhite,"There was a farmer who grew watermelons... ||| He was doing pretty well, but he was disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his water melon patch at night and eat his watermelons. After some careful thought, he came up with a clever idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure. He made up a sign and posted it in the field. The next day, the kids show up and they saw the sign which read, ""Warning! One of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide."" The kids ran off, made up their own sign and posted it next to the farmer's sign. When the farmer returned, he surveyed the field.

""Dear Anita,
Overheating of engine after such short distance can be caused by problems associated with the carburetor. You need to check your oil and water level in your engine before you start your journey.

The younger boy says, ""Hey, man, did you see that? They got peaches any flavor you want!"".

The older boy says ""Nah, they don't. They're just trying to get your attention.""

The younger boy says ""Aw, come on! Let's go get one!""

The older boy just utters ""Fine..."" and quickly does a U-turn back towards the orchard. He parks the truck next to the sign and says ""Alright, get your peach and I'll wait here.""

The younger boy jumps out of the truck and runs towards an old house off in the distance. When he gets there, he sees an old man sitting on a rocking chair on the front porch.

The younger boy says ""Hey, that sign said 'Peaches any flavor you want'. Is it true?"".

The old man replies with ""Sure is. I got peaches any flavor you want."" 

The younger boy says ""Got any flavored like peanut butter and jelly?""

The old man points at a tree, and says ""Sure do. It's that tree just over yonder.""

The younger boy walks over to the tree and picks a peach. He takes a bite, and sure enough, it tastes just like peanut butter. But there's no hint of jelly.

""I can taste the peanut butter, but where's the jelly?"" said the younger boy.

""You just turn that peach on over, son."" says the old man

The younger boy flips the peach over and takes a bite.  The peach tastes just like grape jelly. Excited over this, he runs back to the truck.
 
""It's true! They got peaches any flavor you want!"" said the younger boy.
""Alright, I gotta see this..."" said the older brother as he gets out of the truck.

The older brother makes his way up to the old man's house.

""Alright, he says you got peaches any flavor you want. Is it true?"" said the older boy

""Sure is, sonny. I got all kinds of flavors."" said the old man

The older boy gets a smug look, and replied ""OK... You got one that tastes like pussy?""

With a sly grin, the old man points to a tree and says ""Sure do. It's that tree just over there.""

The older boy walks to the tree and picks a peach. He hesitates, but then takes a big bite. He's disgusted by the taste.

""Ugh, this tastes like shit!"" says the older boy

From the distance, he hears the old man yell ""WELL, TURN IT OVER!""

Skarmorism,"This is a long one. What have I done.... ||| So this nun goes into a bar and there are a bunch of squids and piranhas squabbling over their most recent MMA (mixed martial arts) tournament at the Alpha Squid's house the previous weekend. The piranhas were all like ""hey it's not a fair tournament! The cephalopods always got the advantage! We got good teeth but you can squirt ink and kick us with ya tentacles and stuff!""

And the squids are like ""no, no, no, it's totally fair. Piranhas got more agility and their teeth are just plain deadly, man"". The squids are real defensive of their MMA tourney.

And this nun (who walked into the bar before, remember-bet you didn't remember) speaks up and is like ""hey, why all the fighting? Why do you need an MMA tournament in the first place?""

But then the nun's robe and veil suddenly start talking out of nowhere. Nun's Habits have been known to come alive before, but are usually held back from doing this by a restrictive Papal proclamation put forth by Pope Francis last November-the Holy Habit Constrainment Order, PO #7462.5.


But this nun's robes come alive and stuff and they start taking to these squids and piranhas.

And suddenly things are starting to make sense and the nun's Habit is laying down some awesome new ground rules for the squids' and piranhas' mutual MMA tournaments. Things are looking good.

But then the robes and veil combo, amidst the nun standing around looking bored while her clothes did all the talking, made a suggestion to split up some of the allowed MMA moves per species. It said ""you know what, why don't we limit hand moves like punching and grabbing to the squids, and we'll let the piranhas take all the footwork and agility stuff, like kicks.""

A deathly silence suddenly fell over the room. The Habit said ""what? Did I say something wrong?"" The worried look on its face was reflected by glares from the squids and piranhas alike.

The Alpha Squid stood up on his two strongest legs and walked to the door of the bar. The other squids followed him to the door. The piranhas turned their faces away in fear. At this point the Habit is so confused as to what it said to offend these squids, just being a gentle robe and headpiece and all.

But just as the squids got to the exit, they all turned around, and threw their sunglasses on Squirtle Squad style. The Alpha Squid said, calmly but firmly:

 Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, 'My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100% natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin - not a blemish anywhere. How can you think that the best part of my body is my

 The bartender, while bringing a new round of drinks to their table, overhears their rating of the young lass. He checks her out himself and says, ""Nah, I'd only give her a 2.""

 ""A 2? How can you give her a 2?"" says one of the three guys at the table. ""She's a real pretty girl."" The bartender, walking away, says, ""Well, I use the Budweiser method for rating women.""

 The guys look at each other, figure the bartender has lousy taste in women, and go back to their ratings. Moments later, another young lady, prettier than the last, walks into the bar, and they confer between themselves and decide she deserves a 9.

 However, the bartender, wiping off the table nearest to theirs, again overhears their rating of the gal. He checks her out himself and tells the fellows that he'd only give her a 5.

 ""A 5? How can you give her just a 5? She's absolutely gorgeous!""

 The bartender casually replies that he uses the Budweiser method for rating women.

 ""The Budweiser method?"" they puzzle, as the bartender returns to his post behind the bar. They are quite confused.

 Three, maybe four minutes pass by, and then a stunning blonde, 5'11"" goddess walks into the bar. Long luscious legs, sexy shape. Truly a work of flawless perfection. Without hesitation, the three ""judges"" at the table determine that this young sultress is, without any doubt, a 10.

 However, carrying a case of beer pass them to restock the supply behind the bar, the bartender once more overhears their rating of the girl. He glances studiously at her, and says that the best, the very best that he could give her, would be a 7.

 ""A 7? How in the world could you give her just a mere 7? She's gorgeous!""

 ""Well,"" says the bartender again, ""I use the Budweiser method for rating women.""

 ""Budweiser!"" says one of the guys, exasperated. ""What in the Hell is this 'Budweiser method' for rating women?""

 ""Well, says the bartender, ""the Budweiser method for rating women, is the number of Clydesdales it would take to pull me off her.""",0,2015-06-12

Bushwacker61,"I agree ||| I mowed the lawn today, and after doing so I sat down and had a cold soda.

 The day was really quite beautiful, 
 and the drink facilitated some deep thinking on various topics.

 Finally I thought about the age old question:
 Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?

 Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful 
 than a guy getting kicked in the nuts.


 Well, after another soda, and some heavy deductive thinking, 
 I have come up with the answer to that question.

 Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; 
 and here is the reason for my conclusion.

 A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, 
 ""It might be nice to have another child.""

 On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, 
 ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""

dblee32,"The farmers daughters ||| One Friday night, while driving through a small, backwoods town, a mans car broke down. After walking several miles, the man comes upon a farm house with the lights on. He knocks on the door, and a man clad in dirty overalls answers. The man explains his situation, and asks if it would be possible to stay the night with the farmer until he could get his car fixed in the morning. The farmer explains that the town has but one auto shop, which will not be open again until Monday. He offers to let the stranger spend the weekend, under one condition: "" You are welcome to spend the weekend here. All I ask is that you keep your hands off my two daughters, Nelly and Venus"". The stranger agrees. The next night, Nelly comes to her father and asks permission to go on a date with the stranger. ""I suppose it will be okay"", the farmer says. ""You can use my truck, but no funny business"". That night, the man and Nelly load up in the farmers old beat up truck, drive a few miles down the road to a secluded spot, where he proceeds to bang her brains out. When they finished, they returned to the farm house and went to bed as if nothing had happened. The following night, Venus approaches her father with the same request, and the farmer gives her the same answer. ""I suppose its okay. You can use my truck, but no funny business"". That night, Venus and the stranger take off to the same secluded spot where he had taken Nelly the night before, where he proceeded to bang her brains out. Monday morning comes. The man gets his car fixed and returns to his home in the city. Once he arrives home, he decides to send the farmer some money to show his appreciation, so he writes a check and mails it to him. A couple of months go by, and the man receives an unexpected letter from the farmers address. Inside the envelope he finds a poem, which read as follows: ""Are you the one that done the pushin', and left those stains upon my cushion, and your footprints on my dashboard upside down?

That, to him back then, was a good thing -- after all, the Chinese wish interesting lives on others as a curse. A boring life meant that everything proceeded the way that he liked. No accidents, no oddities, no distractions. No fun, but that's the cost of safety and security.
 
As a child, John never got in a serious accident as a child (except for that time he fell off slide the wrong way, but he landed on a soft spot so that doesn't count). His adolescence was pretty temperate. He even managed not to embarrass himself scarringly in public. After that, he went to a state college, from which he graduated after four years. Then, he got a job offer from a pretty standard company where Dilbert was popular. If this went on for longer, he would have found a lovely (but not -too- lovely) lady to marry and then die surrounded by grandchildren.
 
One day, though, John felt like going to the desert.
 
The idea just struck him on a rather unspecific Friday. On the way to work, John thought to himself, ""After work, I should get an SUV so I can go off-roading."" At work, John thought about the dunes and the winds. On the way from work, John thought about how he has never seen a real desert before. That was very frustrating, so it made buying the most desert-like SUV he could find on a whim easier.
 
John woke up early the next morning. He had a light meal of cereal and strawberries for breakfast. Then he hopped on his new SUV and drove east. Just... east. The highway should take him to a desert in the east, John thought. He fiddled with the audio system a little and tried to find a radio station to listen to. But, no -- the music only distracted him from the excitement he was fermenting in right now. This was an emotion of rare intensity (considering how plaid his life has been), so logically he should savor it to the fullest.
 
With the sun at its zenith, John began to notice the dunes in the distance and the clear, blue sky above them. All inhibition was gone -- he pressed on the gas pedal and the SUV ran at very slightly above the speed limit. He just... had to get there, and feel his car wade through the sand and rocks. There must be so many sights in the wastes to see. He might even run across a saguaro. Ah, damn, he should have brought a camera and someone to take a picture of him next to the tallest saguaro he could find. And before John even realized it himself, he was off the road for the first time.
 
He had a blast. The desert was so different from the city or the beach. Everything felt pure and rarefied there, as if all the dross had been burnt away by the sun's heat. Speaking of which, the sun was blazing hot. Even with the AC at full power, John could feel the desert heat, and the tan that the sun through the window was giving. Anyways, it was probably the first time John went ""crazy"". The sensation of losing control just by a little bit overwhelmed him. The rough terrain rocked him uncomfortably, but he far preferred it to the certain comfort of the office chair. Every once in a he worried if the SUV was going to flip -- but then, it didn't. It gave him a jolt like nothing else. He has never done any hard drugs before, but it must be nothing like off-roading in the desert. Exploring virgin, untrodden sand felt like a series of small conquests. Venturing where no man has gone before, freely going wherever he wan----
 
And then, a blink and a beep.
 
Out of gas.
 
...
 
With a plastic bottle in each hand, John waded through the sand trying to swallow him whole. It was so hard to maintain balance, with the ground shifting and sinking with each footstep. The scorching evening sun didn't help, either. The desert sun at noon must have been more painful, but at least it didn't get in your eye. John had been following the sun for a few hours now. At first, he tried to backtrack, but the tracks had already been erased by the desert wind. ""The desert is to the east,"" John thought, ""so I should go west.""
 
John had already drunk half the bottle of water by the time the sun set. This was pretty bad, because when he got out of the car he expected for the bottle to last at least until tomorrow late afternoon. ""It will be even hotter at noon tomorrow,"" John thought to himself again. ""I'm fucked.""
 
The night cold of the desert gave such a hateful contrast to the day heat. He had heard that it's cold at night in deserts, but John didn't think it would be -this- cold. He was freezing, for God's sake. And it's so arid. John hugged himself even tighter to keep himself warm, next to the tallest saguaro he has ever seen. He thought about getting into the sand to protect himself from the cold, but then sand would get in all of his clothes and he would be annoyed to death tomorrow. He also thought about crying, but he fell unconscious before he could make the decision.
 
The next morning, John once again considered crying, because he must have lost the good bottle over the night. Either the wind took it or it sank into the sand somewhere. Maybe the devil took it, he doesn't know. John looked at the only bottle he has left now -- the bottle with pale blue liquid in it. He has heard that they use water and denatured ethanol in windshield washer fluids and, while it would burn, it would at least quench the thirst. It will probably taste like the worst thing ever, but that's preferable to being mummified alive.
 
The sun was at its zenith when John worked up the courage to try drinking the windshield washer. He kept seeing an oasis in a distance, but it kept running away -- so he concluded that he has begun hallucinating from the heat and the thirst. Might as well try this out anyway, and... Jesus Christ, it tasted like murder. The fluid stabbed at John's dry throat and burned it, like vodka distilled from hate. The pain faded away after a few seconds. Thankfully, his throat wasn't as dry anymore. John resumed to soldier forth.
 
...
 
Why did he listen to the horse? He should have walked -away- from the morning sun, because the sun rises from the east. Thanks to the stupid animal, John was walking the wrong way for half a day. But most importantly -- where did this horse come from?
 
...
 
The sun was setting. John had trouble understanding his own gibberish anymore. It also might have been getting dark faster than is usual for summer, because everything was so hard to see. He drank the last gulp of the windwasher fluid and tossed the bottle away (John would usually not litter). Then he collapsed onto his knees, sinking a little bit into the dune. It's so hard to walk anymore, but crawling was really easy. John fondly regarded his childhood. As the sand cooked his hands and legs, John's life began to play out in his hazy mind like a VHS tape that's been too close to a magnet. ""Life was pretty boring, wasn't it?,"" John's brain stringed together some words. ""Getting into a fight once might have been fun."" All the things he couldn't do, all the regret came in like a tsunami and swept away all hopes for escape. He decided to cry, but he couldn't. He tried wailing, but only dry gasp came out of his throat.
 
John became afraid of death, but then he felt the cold marble floor beneath him.
 
""You look like death,"" a voice said. John looked up, but he could only see black and red spots against a field of dark brown felt. ""You should find help before the cold kills you.""
 
Even in his delirium, John could tell that this must not be real. For one, the voice was too beautiful. Had angels been real, the voice must have belonged to one. But no matter, he just didn't want to die.
 
""I don't want to die.""
 
""Is that a wish?"" the voice replied, now with a tone of definite curiosity. ""I mean, I can help you with that if you so wish. But you have to pay a price. With this contract you mus--""
 
""Just help me.""
 
""Okay, we have a deal,"" said the voice. And then John felt a pair of fangs spear into his throat.
 
...
 
There were so many stars in the night sky. One usually thinks that night is dark, but with so many stars, the night sky was actually bright. Lying with his back against the marble floor (surprisingly comfortable, actually), John tried to trace as many constellations as he could from memory for a few minutes.
 
""Are you feeling better now?,"" a sort-of familiar voice was heard from outside the vision, with concern. ""I broke a few rules, but, you know, I just didn't want to deal with someone dying right in front of me.""
 
John bolted up to see what the fuck just happened right there. He surprised himself -- it was so easy. Not compared to how he was near death, but to how he usually is. Not only that, he felt wonderful.
 
He turned around to see a snake with red eyes. A very large snake with burning red eyes.
 
It took a few seconds for John to assess the situation. And then he said -- ""Thank you... for saving my life.""
 
The snake slithered across the air to get close to John, its tongue feeling the air to smell how he was now. ""No need to thank me, it's all a part of work. Anyways, are you feeling better now?"" 
 
""Yeah. Better than ever, actually."" John tried to figure out exactly what made him feel better. Whatever happened, he now felt more... vigorous, energetic and... unburdened? As if a life-long chain has been lifted. ""What did you do?""
 
""Oh, you know. Granted a wish and all that."" John could have sworn that the snake grinned widely. ""When you came here, you were dying from methanol poisoning. So I detox'd you. You were also very thirsty, so I took care of that. But most importantly, there was a small cancer growing in your liver.""
 
The snake uncoiled itself from a... stick, that emerged from at the center of a very ornately engraved circular white marble floor. As it slithered around the perimeter, the spilt sand was swept away. Apparently it was cleaning the floor. It also showed that the snake must have been at least fifteen yards in length. ""Though, to clarify: you asked for not to die, but that wish is against the rules. So... I gave it a liberal interpretation. So you will not die -for a while-. I made you very healthy, so you probably won't have trouble living to be 120 years old."" The snake nodded its head. ""As long as you don't get yourself killed, you know. It seems like you do stuff like this often.""
 
John shook his head in denial. ""No, this is my first time. And... rules?,"" he questioned. ""Are you some kind of a genie? Or are you the Devil?""
 
The snake made some kind of sound that probably equated to snakes laughing. ""Oh, it never gets old. No, I'm not a genie and I'm not the Devil. I'm just a fallen angel."" It coiled itself against the stick and looked right into John's eyes. The fiery eyes flared like twin suns and rays of starlight descended from the sky to shine in the shape of ephemeral wings on the back. The voice, it suffocated the sound of desert silence and quaked the very space itself. ""I am Nathaniel, the seraph.""
 
""I am John,"" the mortal introduced himself. ""...the office drone.""
 
The fires died out, the lights turned to normal and the rolling sound of silence returned. ""So, yeah. No need to be scared or anything,"" Nathaniel seemed to grin as he spoke. ""I'm just... here doing my job. Speaking of which.""
 
The angel cleared his throat before elaborating on the ""rules"": ""Ok, God sent me here to hire someone for a task. It's a very important and difficult job, so the compensation for it is pretty good. Those who accept the job are given three wishes. These wishes can be anything, as long as you really, actually and truly want it and as long as it doesn't trespass God's authority. And, no, I'm not one of those asshole spirits that twist the wishes or give them literally. God's the one doing the work, so I don't need to be stringent or anything. Your first wish has been fulfilled. You have two wishes left. Be very careful and deliberate for those two, because they have to compensate for the duty you've been given.""
 
""What's my duty?"" John asked, dumbstruck and unable to believe.
 
Nathaniel looked away a little, as if he felt uncomfortable breaking the news. ""Well, ok. John. I'll put this very simply this time. Your duty is to end the world.""
 
Awkward silence followed. Nathaniel seemed to brace for an inevitable tirade. John, to the contrary, was at complete loss for words. The mortal occasionally opened his mouth to say something, perhaps in protest or in confusion, but then he closed it again. He would try again when he felt he had processed the situation sufficiently, but no -- he was wrong. At least for a few minutes.
 
And, eventually. ""So... My job is to end the world.""
 
""Yes.""
 
""Why? And how? And when?""
 
""Well, ok. It's kinda convoluted. And you are handling this very maturely right now, by the way."" Nathaniel coughed softly before continuing. ""As for why... Hm. Imagine that you are making a perpetual motion machine. Once you get it going, it keeps going. Maybe it goes faster and faster if you are good enough at making machines, I don't know. Anyways, when it goes too fast, it's dangerous to stop it from outside. It would hurt if your finger got jammed between the gears, right? So... God made a self-termination switch."" Nathaniel unwound himself from the stick. ""This right here is the switch. God put it here so someone can stop the world from the inside if it becomes necessary.
 
""And now, as for how... It's simple. You -- and only you -- can move this staff. If you push it, pull it, or in any other way disturb it, everything dies. Nothing gets left behind. Nada. Nil. Zilch. Once you do it, it's done."" Nathaniel gestured his tail across his throat. ""It's really easy, but it's total and it's irreversible. That's why it's so hard.""
 
John listened attentively, though he took it only three-quarters-seriously. After all, a talking snake?
 
""Hm. Ok, last question. When... is up to you."" Had Nathaniel been human, a look of doubt and fear would have come across his face. Sadly, he was still a snake. ""It's your job to determine when the world will end. Now that you have been chosen, I can't stop you from deciding when. Even if you try to pull the plug on the world because you got dumped by your girl... well, they say 'significant other' now, don't they? Well, by your significant other, I'm not allowed to stop you in any way or spirit. But I can ask you to be very deliberate. Please, please be very deliberate."" The snake gazed at the human intently. ""There is so much to this world that I haven't seen yet and I would like to learn more about it before it ends.""
 
Nathaniel stopped to speak for a short while. Assuming that he has finished explaining, John brought his right hand to his chin to help him consider the situation. It all was very confusing. Before this day, John didn't believe in God. And, if anything, he wasn't believing in God more at this point. Why would God do this sort of thing? It's all very absurd.
 
But, from the deep of his soul, John could feel that he was given a very, very serious duty.
 
""Why was I chosen?""
 
""You... uh... found me."" Nathaniel shifted his focus away from John, as if he was taken by a sense of inadequacy. ""Long before I had criteria for selecting people for this job, but they were all lousy at it. After a while, I decided to not have any at all."" The snake sighed. ""I think it's been working out greatly. Somehow random people are more emotionally stable than prophesied legendary heroes.""
 
""What if I don't want to do it?""
 
""It's too late.""
 
""Can I wish not to have to do this?""
 
Nathaniel sighed. ""No, that's infringing on God's authority, so it's against the rules. You -have- to do it, John. And I'm pretty sure you will be good at it.""
 
""How do you know that?"" John accused the angel of empty words of comfort.
 
""I have been talking to you for a good while now, haven't I?"" The snake's facial muscles did their best to smile. ""After a few billion years, you learn how to read people.""
 
It seemed that John wanted to argue with that, but only silence followed for a moment.
 
""This is a stupid job.""
 
""It pays well.""
 
...
 
On the circle, the night air felt cool rather than cold. Waiting for dawn's light, John watched the stars trace the globe of the sky once he ran out of things to ask Nathaniel about. Well, he was curious if he was actually an angel and, if he was, what it is like to be an angel.
 
But that all felt improper.
 
John found the morning star when the skirt of the sky began to grow yellow, pink and red. In minutes, it would be bright again. He would have to find a way to get back home from here. Perhaps continuing going west is the best course of action--
 
""If you walk south from here for about three hours, you will find a highway. Go eastbound and there will be a small town. If you tell them that you got lost while off-roading, they will help you out,"" Nathaniel interrupted John's train of thought. ""And you must be hungry, right? Here, have something to eat before you head out.""
 
A plate consisting of a loaf of bread, a chunk of cheese and a mug of wine sat on the marble floor.
 
""Thanks, but where did you get this?""
 
""Heaven.""
 
...
 
John dusted his pants one more time. As he stepped outside the border of the marble circle, he could feel the sun grow a thousand times more fierce.
 
""Uh, hey, Nate,"" John said hesitantly. ""Do you mind if I come back later for the other two wishes? I can't think of anything good right now.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel. And it's ok, that's what most people do when they don't feel like asking for money.""
 
""People seriously ask for money?"" John asked in surprise at the banality.
 
""Well, I know what you mean. I think it's odd when people ask for money over... true love, or peace, or anything like that. I asked a few why.""
 
""What did they say?""
 
""'You are too young to understand'. Which is kind of funny, because, you know, billions of years old,"" the snake seemed to smirk. ""But they probably meant that I'm not close enough to death to understand.""
 
John seemed clearly unsatisfied at the answer or the extrapolation. ""I still don't get it. It'd be nice to understand what they meant. Perhaps I'll ask for that when I come back later. To understand what other people are saying.""
 
Nathaniel's tongue licked the air a few times. ""That would be interesting. I don't think anyone has asked for that before. Do you want that wish granted now?""
 
John hesitated for a moment.
 
""Nah. I need a reason to come back here for.""
 
With that, John smiled brightly at Nathaniel, and walked south.
 
...
 
After that weekend, John's life seemed to return to normal. The snake stopped appearing in his dreams after a week or so and he eventually forgot that he doesn't need health check-ups anymore in three months' time. It was boring again. Very stable, but boring.
 
A year since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.
 
""Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,"" the barrel of the gun said.
 
John reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown wallet. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, wondering: ""Why do you want this?""
 
The barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.
 
After that encounter, John remembered that wish he wanted granted.
 
...
 
This time, John drew a map. He learned from the Internet how to prepare for desert exploration. Over a period of a month, he gathered the tools and gears needed to save him the pain. Learning how to locate himself using the stars would have been useful, but that's too much work; he'll just bet on his luck on that. With a rental SUV, he drove his way to the small village to the southeast and, from there, carefully trekked up north with a pair of binoculars. He started his search in the morning and found Nathaniel by mid-afternoon.
 
""What's up?"" the angel asked.
 
""I got mugged,"" John answered.
 
""Ah, damn. Did you get hurt?"" A tone of worry and concern colored Nathaniel's voice.
 
""No, but it helped me remember something."" John spoke very evenly. Perhaps he wanted to come off unconcerned?
 
""Nearly dying once?""
 
""Huh."" John amusedly reviewed the situation, now and back then. ""Maybe. I should hire a psychoanalyst.""
 
""Freudians are a bunch of quacks. And they are very expensive,"" dismissed Nathaniel.
 
John replied with a smile. ""It's fun, though.""
 
The conversation broke for about ten seconds; a period during which desert gust blew across the landscape.
 
""Hey, Nate.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel. And time to pull the plug?"" The angel put on a very as-a-matter-of-factly attitude.
 
""Um."" John put his right hand on his chin to help him consider the proposition, but: ""No, not today.""
 
Nathaniel breathed a sigh of relief.
 
""I actually came back for my second wish.""
 
""I would have preferred if you came for friendship.""
 
It broke for another time; during this period, a desert creature cried out in the far back.
 
""You think of me as a friend?"" John asked with honest awe.
 
""Anybody's your friend when your neighbors are rocks and cacti."" The snake clicked his tongue. ""I don't have that many people to talk to, being bound here and all.""
 
""Really? You can't leave?""
 
""Well."" Nathaniel hesitated. ""I can leave... I think. Well, probably not. Anyways, if I do I might not see you come here and pull the lever. Then I won't be able to plug my ears.""
 
""I thought everyone just... died. Nothing loud.""
 
""Well, everyone just dies, yeah. In very big explosions.""
 
""You can't plug your ears. You don't have arms.""
 
""I can try.""
 
The sound of sands rolling down the dunes punctuated the conversation.
 
""I want you to grant me my second wish."" John demanded.
 
Excited to find out what John has in mind, Nathaniel eagerly questioned. ""Oh? What will it be this time?""
 
""I want to be able to understand people.""
 
The snake paused for a second, perhaps to discern whether it would be a good wish for John or not. In the end, he said: ""That is a very difficult wish to live with, you know that?""
 
""I figured so.""
 
""Well, no regrets.""
 
Nathaniel bit John.
 
...
 
When John woke up, the sun was setting. Stars could be faintly seen through the still-pale blue sky, and a pregnant moon was floating about as well. A shooting star burnt through the atmosphere, leaving a short trail, far away from John's focus when a curious voice was heard.
 
""Are you feeling better now?""
 
""Um. Yeah."" John reoriented himself. ""Thanks, Nate.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel.""
 
""Now that I think about it, do I annoy you when I call you Nate?"" John asked the angel, with sincerity.
 
""Well,"" Nathaniel considered the question. ""A little?""
 
""But that's how a friend would call you. Nathaniel is a mouthful.""
 
""Agreed on that. But, you know."" The angel paused for a second.
 
""What is it?""
 
Nathaniel slowly uncoiled himself from the switch and slithered toward the perimeter, dutifully. ""God gave me this name.""
 
The sound of Nathaniel's scales against the marble floor and the sand grains on it filled the air.
 
""I think I can understand that."" John admitted. ""I still don't believe in God, but I think I can understand that.""
 
The snake giggled. ""Is that because you learned how to understand me?""
 
""No. Actually, no, I don't think so."" John gripped his chin. ""At least, this isn't what I asked for.""
 
Nathaniel laughed.
 
...
 
John didn't bother sitting up that night. He just laid comfortably on his back and watched the stars, while chatting with Nathaniel about, in sum, everything about the world.
 
""Hey, you said you can't leave the circle, right? But you seem pretty up to date,"" John asked.
 
""Doves,"" answered Nathaniel. ""They drop by every once in a while.""
 
John finally asked the angel about whether he was really an angel or not. The answer was very elaborate -- Nathaniel was apparently very proud of the time before he fell. He explained what it is like to be in Heaven and in presence of God. It all sounded like some fantasy novel to John, but even then, it was the most interesting fantasy novel. Perhaps because it was being told in person, and by a very excited character?
 
""Hey, Nathaniel, I hope you don't mind me asking, but..."" John considered the true worth of bringing this up. ""Why did you fall""?
 
""Um. How do I put this?"" Nathaniel pondered for a second or so. ""I wanted to explore the world that God made more closely.""
 
""That's it?""
 
""I accidentally ended the dinosaurs.""
 
""Oh.""
 
Nathaniel asked if John liked to travel. John didn't, so he said no. When it was apparent that Nathaniel was disappointed (perhaps he wanted to hear travel stories), John explained that he wasn't a very adventurous person. He has never done anything out of ordinary in his life and he has grown too comfortable with it. Travelling explicitly means leaving one's comfort zone. John could never do that.
 
""But you came here,"" wondered Nathaniel.
 
""You are right.""
 
""Maybe this could be a first step.""
 
""I'll think about it.""
 
And then it was morning.
 
...
 
John promised to return soon when he left Nathaniel this time. He meant it -- after all, this might be a good way to break out of his routine. Furthermore, Nathaniel so badly wants to travel and explore but can't. To linger in the comfort zone forever would be an insult to a good friend.
 
And so John quit his office job and began to travel around the world, for a few years.
 
First, he went to India. Then Tibet, followed by Maghreb. He went to Europe, but did not go to Britain. Hungary was very enjoyable, even though he ran out of money there. John washed dishes and kicked people out of clubs for a few months -- he met many interesting people doing so. Once he's gathered enough money, he hopped on a boat back to America. Over the Atlantic, John finished his plans on walking across and around North America.
 
...
 
""I brought you books.""
 
""I thought you died.""
 
""Can you read?""
 
""You lied when you'd return soon.""
 
""Well.""
 
...
 
Back in his apartment, John tried to figure out his next course of action. He learned a lot in the last five years from all that travel and all that talk, he thought. Perhaps writing about the lessons might be a good idea.
 
...
 
""I brought you books.""
 
""Ooh! Did you bring yours, too?""
 
""What? Why would you need self-help books?""
 
""I have a lot of time to improve myself.""
 
""You've been like that for a few billion years.""
 
""Well.""
 
...
 
Sixty years since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.
 
""Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,"" the barrel of the gun said.
 
John reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown notepad. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, saying: ""All I have is names and directions.""
 
The barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.
 
John remembered the last wish.
 
...
 
When John climbed the last dune to the marble circle, he noticed that Nathaniel brought someone for their monthly meeting. It was quite out of the ordinary, but no matter -- if a good friend wants to introduce him to them, then it must be good.
 
""What's up?"" The angel asked.
 
""I got mugged,"" John answered.
 
""Again?""
 
John shrugged, as if at a loss for a proper response. ""Well, this is the second time. At least that I remember.""
 
""Hm,"" Nathaniel reconsidered. ""It feels like yesterday for me.""
 
""So..."" John eyed the new guest.
 
""Ah, yes."" The big snake encircled the little snake and tightened in, probably affectionately. ""This is my daughter, John. I want you to meet her.""
 
The words brought a smile to John's face. He leaned down to be closer to the child. ""Hi. What's your name?""
 
""Call me Sarai.""
 
""My name is John."" Saying his, he offered his hand. ""It's very nice to meet you.""
 
The girl extended her tail and gripped onto the index finger. Will do for a handshake.
 
""Now that I've met such an adorable young girl,"" John mused, ""I can't pull the lever in front of her anymore.""
 
""Speaking of which...""
 
The unusual heaviness of Nathaniel's voice made John uncomfortable, and maybe a little queasy.
 
""Before that happens, old friend. Could you grant me a wish this time?""
 
...
 
First, they were going to ride across Canada and America. After that they will head down south, driving around South America by the Pacific and the Atlantic. It would be very nice if they could head to the Amazon, too, but it was doubtful that it had accommodations for an RV.
 
Sarai sat on John's right shoulder as they traveled. She would be so excited to see anything that isn't made of sand and rocks. It reminded John of himself back long ago, when he first came to the desert. It was so different. It might have been meaningless to someone who has always been there, but to outsiders, it's exotic and special. Perhaps this is why Nathaniel is so curious about the world -- he is an outsider to all but the tiny little circle in the desert. Everything is exotic and special to him.
 
The best he could do for him was to show the world to his child. When they have seen every thing there is to see in this world, Sarai will go home and tell her father all about it. Nathaniel might not be able to leave until the day he dies, but at least he would have explored the world vicariously. Little satisfactions.
 
...
 
""Hey, John, what should we tell him first about?"" Sarai asked John, on their way to the desert.
 
""I don't know, Sarai. What was the most fun for you?""
 
""Mmm."" The girl pondered. ""I liked the mountains. They were like the dunes, except really big and really tall.""
 
""Which mountains? We saw many of them, didn't we?""
 
""Ehhh. I can't remember them all.""
 
It's been six months since Nathaniel asked John to show Sarai the world. Before leaving for Africa, she wanted to see her father again. John agreed -- it might be years they might be spending there, this time. Furthermore, he couldn't wait for his third wish.
 
The road and the desert seemed different this time. Almost... like the first time. Sense of excitement and wonder. Was it because they couldn't wait to share their experience with Nathaniel? In any case, they had to see him as quickly as possible.
 
The RV crawled up the dunes rather slowly. It seemed to do so well everywhere else... But this was the last time they will be riding this thing. On the other hand, it was somewhat nostalgic for John. The imbalance on the sand. The uncomfortable rocking. The loss of control.
 
The loss of control.
 
""DADDY!!!"" The moment she spotted him down the dune, Sarai screamed from John's shoulder. He must have pressed either the brake or the gas pedal too hard. The wheels spun out of control in the sand. The weight of the RV slowly dragged it down the slope, gradually but surely accelerating as it goes. John tried to regain control, but it seemed too late.
 
And it was heading right onto the circle.
 
Nathaniel had already uncoiled himself from the lever, to see what's going on with the RV sliding down the dune. And then he realized -- it is John who is driving that thing... and it is in crash course with the switch that will end the world.
 
John noticed the very large snake bunch up between the falling vehicle and the switch. At the rate it's going, the RV will hit Nathaniel and flip. That surely would kill Nathaniel, but the alternative is the lever behind him. But can John live with himself after killing his oldest friend like this? If he can't live with that, then maybe it's better to swerve, so the lever instead of Nathaniel will be hit. Either way, John's world will have come to end.
 
And to think that John's last wish was for Nathaniel to be free from his duty so he can explore the world with them.
 
A mere second before impact.
 
John had to choose.

	A woman walks into a pet store looking for a new pet. After a few minutes of browsing around, she's not impressed by what she finds. She's about to walk out, until she looks behind the sales counter and spots the most unusual bird she's ever seen. She asks the salesman what it is.  
	""Oh, that's a crunch bird!"" he says.   
	""Crunch bird? Never heard of it. What does it do?"" she asks.   
	""Just watch!"" he says as he opens the cage. ""Crunch bird, chair!"" He points to a wooden chair in the corner of the store. The bird flies out of the cage and heads straight for it. Within a matter of seconds, it's reduced to a pile of sawdust.   
	The woman is impressed, but asks for another demonstration.   
	""Crunch bird, desk!"" the salesman says, pointing at a nearby desk. Once again, the bird aims straight for it, and turns it to dust in a matter of seconds.  
	""I'll take him!"" the woman says.   
	He tells her it's not for sale, but she begs and tells him money is no object. Finally put in a corner, he accepts her offer, and she takes the bird home.  
	Her husband arrives home from work a while later and immediately spots the cage.

When Bill and Hillary first got married Bill said, ""I put a box under the bed. Promise me you will never to look in it."" In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. On the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In it were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. 

  
She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there was such a box and with those contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner. After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, “I'm so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?” 
  

Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.” Hillary was shocked, but thought, ""Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. And since I know he is addicted to sex, three times is not too bad.” 

 
She said, ”OK Bill, I guess I can forgive you.” Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""So why do you have all that money in the box?” 
  

He answered, ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center.""

zzgoogleplexzz,"The Husband Store ||| A store that sells new husbands has just opened in New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids . 

'That's nice', she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex, have big tits and lots of money.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",223,2015-06-14

rumblefish65,"Underwear ||| Three couples were golfing, a Swedish couple, an Irish couple, and a Scottish couple. 

The Swede`s wife steps up to the tee and, as she bends over to place her ball, a gust of wind blows her skirt up and reveals her lack of underwear. 

'Good God, woman! Why aren't you wearing any skivvies?', Ole demanded. 

'Well, you don't give me enough housekeeping money to afford any.' 

The Swede immediately reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 50. Go and buy yourself some underwear. 

Next, the Irishman's wife bends over to set her ball on the tee. Her skirt also blows up to show that she, too, is wearing no undies. 

'Blessed Virgin Mary, woman! You've no knickers. Why not?' 

She replies, 'I can't afford any on the money you give me.' 

Patrick reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 20. Go and buy yourself some underwear!' 


Lastly, the Scotsman's wife bends over. The wind also takes her skirt over her head to reveal that she, too, is naked under it. 

'Sweet mudder of Jaysus, Aggie! Where ta friggin hell are yer drawers?' 

She too explains, 'You dinna give me enough money ta be able ta affarrd any.' 

The Scotsman reaches into his pocket and says, 'Well, fer the love 'o decency, here's a comb..... Tidy yourself up a bit. “",50,2015-06-14

So the three of them went to a nearby lake and cast out a small row boat in the middle of the lake. Now it was getting to be around midday, and the sun was beating down on the three men. The priest suddenly stood up and exclaimed ""My, it is becoming a very hot day and we forgot to pack some drinks. I am going to go the store and get some soda for myself."" So the priest jumped off the boat, walked on the water to the shore, went to the store and bought a soda. He then came back to the boat the same way and once again started to fish. The preacher after some time told the other two that he was feeling thirsty as well and will be going to the store. So the preacher stood up, jumped off the boat, walked on the water to the shore, went to the store and bought some water. Like the priest, he came back to the boat and began to fish. The rabbi saw what the other two did and sat there in disbelief. He couldn't believe that they both were able to walk on water. So he said to them, ""Hmph it is so easy to walk on water anyone can do it. I am also going to go to the store to get something to drink."" So the rabbi jumped out of the boat and then began to flail around in the water. The priest and the preacher looked at each other.

AdmiralTripsMuldoon,"An American, a Canadian and a Scotsman get into a car accident... ||| This is a joke my friend told me... I paraphrase, but the main parts are all there.

An American, a Canadian and a Scotsman get into a car accident... and they all fuckin die. Just like that. BOOM. Dead. No survivors.
Seeing as they all died at the exact same moment, they all arrive at the Pearly Gates together.
They all walk up to St. Peter to see what deal is on getting into heaven... St. Peter sayeth unto them, ""I can tell by the looks of yas that you're all sinners... but we seem to be having some sort of malfunction with our registry, so for 50 units of each of your currency respectively, we'll just let you in.""
The American, knowing a good deal when he hears it, opens his wallet and hands a crisp $50 bill to St. Peter without hesitation. St. Peter thanks the man and pulls the lever to let him through the gates.
The American can't believe his luck. He's struttin through Heaven with a big shit-eating grin on his face, waiving at all the angels and familiar faces... and after several minutes, he realizes his friends who died with him are nowhere to be found. Concerned, he inquires to an angel about his friend's whereabouts.
""The last I heard,"" sayeth the angel unto him, ""the Canadian was trying to get his government to pay his fee, and the Scotsman was still hagglin the price.""

Someone sitting next to him says, ""My cataracts is so bad I can barely see my coffee.""

Someone behind them then says, ""I can't even turn my head anymore"" and everyone in the room nods in agreement.

The optimist among them then says, ""Hey its not so bad, at least we all still have our drivers license.""

Extra backstory: I went to Church with my grandparents today, and my grandpa wanted to drive. He is 77 years old and an awful driver. It takes both my grandparents to drive. My grandpa steers and my grandma sits in the back to tell him when he can switch lanes, back up, anything like that (because he can't turn his head). He also doesn't observe speed limit signs. He doesn't drive fast, its just whatever the speed limit is he cruises around 25mph. The road to my church has a speed limit of 40. His response while driving?

“It starts at $500 for a hand-job,” replies the hooker.

“$500 dollars? For a hand-job?” says the guy “No hand-job is worth that kind of money!”

So the hooker says, “Do you see that Denny’s on the corner?”

“Yes.”

“Do you see the Denny’s about a block further down?”

“Yes.”

“And beyond that, do you see that third Denny’s?”

“Yes.”

“Well,” says the hooker, smiling invitingly, “I own those. And, I own them because I give a hand-job that’s worth $500.”

The guy thinks to himself, “What the hell? You only live once. I’ll give it a try.” and accepts the hooker’s offer. They retire to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realising that he just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500. He is so amazed, he says, “I suppose a blow-job is $1,000?”

“$1,500″ says the hooker

“I wouldn’t pay that for a blow-job!” he says

The hooker replies, “Step over here to the window, big boy. Do you see that casino just across the street? I own that casino outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that’s worth every cent of $1,500.”

The guy, basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, decides to put off the new car for another year or so, and says, “OK Sign me up.”

Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before. He can scarcely believe it, but he feels he truly got his money’s worth. He decides to dip into the retirement savings for one glorious and unforgettable experience. He asks the hooker, “How much for some pussy?”

The hooker says, “Come over here to the window, I want to show you something. Do you see how the whole city of Las Vegas is laid out before us, all those beautiful lights, gambling palaces, and showplaces?”

“Damn!” the guy says, in awe, “You own the whole city?”

“Nope,” says the hooker, “but I would if I had a pussy.”

vasovist,"If airlines sold paint (from Car Talk) ||| Customer: Hi. How much is your paint?

Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends on quite a lot of things.

Customer: Can you give me a guess? Is there an average price?

Clerk: Our lowest price is $12 a gallon, and we have 60 differentprices up to $200 a gallon.

Customer: What's the difference in the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.

Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.

Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint?

Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.

Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.

Customer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?

Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of thatweek and continue painting until at least Sunday.

Customer: You've got to be *...%^#@* kidding!

Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.

Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!

Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sellonly a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by theway, the price per gallon just went to $16. We don't have any more $12paint.

Customer: The price went up as we were talking?

Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds oftimes a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with yourpaint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint assoon as possible. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll haveenough.

Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don'tuse it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint youalready have.

Customer: WHAT?

Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom,hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do thebedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint.

Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? IAlready paid you for it!

Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea thatall our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts ofproblems.

Customer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible happensif I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!

Clerk: Oh yes! Every gallonyou bought automatically becomes the $200 paint.

Customer: But what are all these ""Paint on sale from $10 alitre"" signs?

Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The second half-gallon tocomplete the room is $20. None of the cans have labels,some are empty and there are norefunds, even on the empty cans.

Customer: I can't believe this! I'll buy what I need somewhereelse!

Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint forYour bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room fromsomeone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairwayfrom anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in onlyone direction, it will be $300 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!

Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at whichYou started. A hallway is different.

Customer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only paintin one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint.

Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the differenceon your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.

""I was cleaning some grease of off some car parts this weekend and had a little gasoline in a cup sitting on the floor of the garage. My dog walks in and I hear the sound of the lapping up of water. I quickly realized that my dog was drinking the gasoline! 

I get up to get the dog and he just takes off like a bat out of hell. He runs around the yard and I just can't catch him. I'm about ready to give up from exhaustion when he keels over, like he's dead. I quickly rushed him to the vet.

Son: ""Dad, now I think I understand what Politics is.""

surelyucantbserious,"Once there was a man named Zade Zazinski... ||| Once there was a man named Zade Zazinski.  Zade was always last for everything due to his name.  Everything always seemed to run out before Zade received his portion.  Schoolbooks, supplies, food rations.  Disappointed, Zade joined the military out of high school thinking that he would be treated equally by the armed forces.  


Once he arrived at basic training things did not go as planned. He went to the rifle range on his first day.  His drill sergeant told him, “Sorry Zazinski, we’ve run out of rifles. You’ll just have to pretend out there.” Since Zade had so much practice at making due with what he had, he went with it.  Zade stepped up to the firing line, held an imaginary rifle up and said, “Bang. Bang. Bang.”   The next day he received a certificate for good marksmanship.


The following day’s training consisted of learning how to use a bayonet.  Again, the drill sergeant said, “Sorry Zazinski. We’ve run out of bayonets, you’ll just have to pretend.”  So again, Zade stepped up to the hanging dummy and screamed “Stab. Stab. Stab.” The next day he received commendations for good bayonetsmanship.


On the third day the group headed to the grenade range.  Again the drill sergeant said, “Zazinski, we have no more grenades. You’ll just have to pretend out there.”  So Zade threw imaginary grenades while making explosion sounds, “Brooosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” The next day he received high honors for good grenade throwing.


Soon after, Zade was deployed to war.  With the honors he received at basic, Zazinski hoped he would be the dependable soldier they needed on the warfront.  Deep down he knew it would happen, but Zazinski was still disappointed to learn that there was not enough equipment to go around.  Again he was told to just pretend.  


Zade is sent to the front lines.  He sees the enemy soldiers in the distance.  Grabbing his rifle, Zade took aim and said, “Bang. Bang. Bang.” Three enemy soldiers fell over dead.  


As they advanced further, Zade pulled the fake pins from his faux grenades and lobbed them at the enemy saying, “Broosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” Giant explosions tore through the enemy, killing at least 20 combatants.  


Soon the enemy was close enough to require close combat.  Once again, Zade reacted by attaching his bayonet and screaming, “Stab. Stab. Stab.”  Anyone who got close fell with knife wounds in their bodies.


Zade continued to use his fake weaponry to decimate the battlefield.  Shouts of “Bang, Stab, Broosh,” echoed across the wasteland that was the warzone.  Enemy soldiers fell left and right.  It seemed that no one was safe from the onslaught of Zazinski.  Casualties piled up until finally, there were only two people left; Zazinski, and an enemy soldier who marched directly at him.


“Bang. Bang. Bang.” said Zade, but nothing happened.



“Broosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” Again, nothing.



Soon the enemy was within bayonet range.



“Stab. Stab. Stab.” 



Nothing.



With a look of disbelief Zazinski fell underneath the relentless forward march of the enemy soldier.



Zade had just enough time to look the soldier over, noticing the name tag reading ‘Zembrowski,’ and to hear the final words of his life spoken by the enemy:


“Tank. Tank. Tank.”

**BLAM!** The bear drops to the ground. Ivan runs over to where the bear fell… no bear. Someone taps him on the shoulder. He turns around, and it’s the bear.
    
The bear snarls, “Did you just shoot at me?”
   
“Uhhh, yeah.”
    
“Alright, now you gotta blow me.”
    
What can Ivan do? It’s suck bear cock or be ripped apart and devoured. So, he holds his breath and blows the bear. He licks and sucks for what feels like hours. At last, the bear grunts, spooges all over Ivan’s face, taps him on the shoulder appreciatively, and ambles away contented.
    
The next week, Ivan goes to the black market, buys a Kalashnikov assault rifle, and goes hunting again. Soon he comes across enormous bear tracks. He follows them for a couple of hours till he comes across the same brobdingnagian bear. He switches the selector to full auto, takes careful aim, and pulls the trigger.
    
**RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!!!** The bear drops. Ivan dashes toward the bear… no bear. There’s another tap on his shoulder. It’s the bear come up behind him.
    
“Did you just fire a machine gun at me?”
    
“Uhhh, yeah.”
    
“Alright, now I’m going to fuck you in the ass!”
    
What can Ivan do? It’s take bear cock up the ass or be ripped apart and devoured. So he bends over and takes it like a man. The bear diddles him for what feels like hours. At long last, he grunts, spooges all over Ivan’s backside, taps him on the shoulder appreciatively, and ambles away contented.
    
Now, Ivan is really mad. The next week, he travels to an obscure ex-Soviet republic and buys himself a shoulder-mounted SAM-20 missile. He’s going to kill that infamous bear once and for all, no matter what it takes. He returns to the woods and tracks the bear. He aims the missile and launches it at the ursine degenerate.
    
**BOOOOOOOM!!!** The bear drops. Ivan sprints towards it… no bear. A tap on his shoulder. Yep, it’s the bear.
    
The bear sticks his paw in his mouth and blows a shrill whistle. At once, four other bears converge upon the hapless hunter. They pant and grunt as they amble towards him. Their beady eyes radiate with a lewd glare. Their monstrous leader stares at Ivan and drawls,

They raise the blade of the guillotine and release it. It comes speeding down and suddenly stops just inches from his neck. The authorities take this as divine intervention and release the priest.

The drunkard comes to the guillotine next. He also decides to die face up, hoping that he will be as fortunate as the priest. They raise the blade of the guillotine and release it.

With the last chime of the clock at midnight, the Warrens hear footsteps coming towards the bed, getting louder with every passing moment. A tall demonish figure reaches the bed, takes something out of his jacket, looks at it and makes an angry grunt. As he bends towards the bed, the Warrens run to subjugate the demon with the holy cross and water simultaneously turning on all the lights.

The frog called for the two to stop and said, ""Because you are the only two animals I have seen, I will grant both of you three wishes. Bear, you can go first."" The bear thought for a moment, and being the male he said, ""I wish for all the bears in this forest, apart from me, to be female.""

It's the bear's second turn for a wish. ""Well, I wish that all the bears in the next forest are female as well."" 

The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it and roared the engine. The bear is shocked that the rabbit is asking for such idiotic items, because after all, he could have asked for money and bought the bike.

After almost giving up the townsfolk heard the sound of a fire truck! They jumped for joy as they saw it flashing its lights and driving fast down a hill. When the fire truck reached the Town Hall it crashed straight into the building, and they started to put the fire out from the inside.

After about 10 minutes they had done it, the fire was out. The mayor of the town congratulated the firemen and awarded them the key to the city and $10,000. The mayor then asked ""what are you going to do with your money"" and the fire chief replied ""well, the first thing we're gonna do it buy some new breaks for this stupid truck!""",1,2015-06-16

After just a few seconds of this the vet takes a step back and says ""I'm sorry ma'am, but this duck is dead."" The woman exclaims ""What? You've barely examined him! Is there anything else you can do? He's not dead, he's just sick! I'm sure of it!"" The vet exhales and reluctantly, opens the door, and leads in a large dog. He motions for the dog to get on the table, after which the dog begins to sniff the duck up and down. The duck still lies motionless. After a few minutes of this the dog hops back down, walks back over to the vet and nods his head.

The vet leads the dog back out of the room but this time returns with a cat. The vet leads the cat to the duck, and in a similar fashion the cat begins to sniff the duck up and down. After a minute or two, the cat jumps off the table, walks to the vet, and nods his head. All the while the duck still remains lifeless on the table. The vet leads the cat out of the room and returns shortly with a bill for the woman.

The vet hands the woman the bill and tells her, ""I'm sorry, but your pet is dead, there's nothing more we can do ma'am.""

Before I lay me down to sleep,
I pray for a man who's not a creep,

One who loves to listen long,
One who thinks before he speaks,
One who'll call, not wait for weeks.. 
I pray he's rich and self-employed,
And when I spend, won't be annoyed.
Pull out my chair and hold my hand..
Massage my feet and help me stand.

In the hope that she will get to see them some day, she leaves her personal information with the adoption agency just in case the boys want to meet their biological mother in the future. One of the boys gets adopted by a family in Egypt and is named “Ahmal.” The other was taken in by a family in Spain, and they name him “Juan.” She hopes that their new lives will have more to offer them, and that they will be happy there.


Years later, the woman is much better off financially, and is living a new life in a nice house with a new man in her life. However, she still always thinks about her sons, and keeps her information at the agency up to date just in case they ask for her.


As luck has it, Juan decides one day that he wants to reconnect with his birth mother. He gets her information from the agency and sends her a picture of himself. Upon receiving the picture she is absolutely thrilled to see how he has grown, how handsome he is, and how happy he seems to be. She hopes that Ahmal is doing well too and tells her husband that she wishes she had a picture of Ahmal as well. Her husband responds, ""They’re identical twins, honey.

He realized he'd left his gun at home and so he couldn't shoot the magnificent creature. Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it at the animal as if it were his favorite hunting rifle, and went 'bang, bang'...Miraculously, two shots rang out and the beaver fell over dead.

One day he arrives home looking downcast.

His wife sympathizes and makes him a cup of tea. As they sit down, she says, ""Why don't you take my brother with you and give it one more try.""

""That's no good,"" sighs Arthur. ""Your brother's a hundred and three. He can't help.""

""He may be a hundred and three,"" says the wife, ""but his eyesight is perfect.""

“Roberto, how did you get those black eyes?”


“Well Juan, you know how I’ve been attending that new church?  Two Sundays ago I went to service and there was a beautiful behemoth of a woman sitting in the pew in front of me wearing a very nice sun dress.  Everything was going normally. The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After 20 minutes he told us to stand up and I noticed that the women’s dress had worked its way into her ass crack.  Being the thoughtful guy I am, I casually reached over and plucked her dress from the crevasse it had become lodged in.  As soon as she felt her dress move, the woman turned around and punched me right in the eye!”


“Ouch!” said Juan. “That must have hurt! But how did you come by the second black eye?”


“Well Juan, the very next Sunday I returned to church.  This time I took my cousin Manny with me.  Sure enough, the same woman was sitting directly in front of us.  I promised myself that no matter what happened I was not going to let last week’s incident happen again.  The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After some time he told us to stand up and sure enough that women’s dress had migrated back into her ass crack.  Before I could say anything my cousin Manny reached up and plucked the dress from its prison!  Quick as lightning I extended my hand and shoved that dress right back where it came from, shouting ‘Put it back in!’”


“Roberto, I need to find a new church. I’m not allowed back there anymore.”

Uglyolddude,"A guy picks up a girl at a bar and takes her home. ||| They get back to her place and things are progressing appropriately. They are on the couch making out when he slips a hand up her skirt and discovers there are no panties. Excited he starts rubbing her and after a bit works a finger in there. She seems to be enjoying herself and he doesn’t mind the bit of work so he starts working another finger in. She is getting a bit more aggressive and is clearly having a good time so what the hell he works his other two in leaving his thumb to work her clit. Well the girl is having a blast and is beginning to moan a bit. She starts asking for more. The guy is not all that drunk and kinda intrigued he figures “what the hell let’s see where I can take this.” He starts to work his other hand up beside the first one a few minutes goes by and he has everything but his thumbs in this girl and she is getting really loud now. She’s moaning away grabbing her tits and yelling more! More. So the guy pulls back a bit on his hands and works his thumbs in. After a few more minutes he’s wrist deep and beginning to get concerned. What the hell is going on here? Who is this girl and how was I ever going to satisfy her anyways? Meanwhile she has her heals on the couch and is trusting herself up and down screaming more, more! So he starts pushing away on his hands and he gets to his elbows. He is deeply concerned about being swallowed whole and is no longer comfortable with the situation and yet completely enraptured by the idea of how far this can possible go. So he keeps pushing away when all of the sudden he pots up to his shoulders. Clearly this chick is hollow. She must be built like a pylon. He is reminded of Russian doll figurers who are completely hollow and have another person inside of them. He has a quick thought about how this little 5’6 lady must have a vortex to a different dimension in her that is feeding her excitement at the cost of his limbs. Meanwhile she’s just in utter ecstasy she is yelling away and completely oblivious to everything around her when all of the sudden she stops cold. She looks him right in the eyes and says want to see something awesome? Try to clap. The guy is up to his shoulders inside this girl. He can’t move let alone clap. He looks at her and says “I can’t.” With a smug smile on her face she says “tight huh.”",0,2015-06-17

Bushwacker61,"When I was 10 ||| Around age 10 my dad got me one of those little badass compound bow beginner kits. Of course, the first month I went around our land sticking arrows in anything that could get stuck by an arrow. Did you know that a 1955 40 horse Farmall tractor tire will take 6 rounds before it goes down? Tough sumbich.

   That got boring, so being the 10 yr. old Dukes of Hazard fan that I was, I quickly advanced to taking strips of cut up T-shirt doused in chainsaw gas tied around the end and was sending flaming arrows all over the place.

   One summer afternoon, I was shooting flaming arrows into a large rotten oak stump in our backyard. I looked over under the carport and see a shiny brand new can of starting fluid (Ether). The light bulb went off in my head.

   I grabbed the can and set it on the stump. I thought that it would probably just spray out in a disappointing manner. Lets face it, to a 10 yr old mouth-breather like myself, (Ether), really doesn't ""sound"" flammable.

  So, I went back into the house and got a 1 pound can of pyrodex (black powder for muzzle loader rifles).

   At this point, I set the can of ether on the stump and opened up the can of black powder. My intentions were to sprinkle a little bit around the (Ether) can but it all sorta dumped out on me. No biggie, a 1 lb. pyrodex and 16 oz (Ether) should make a loud pop, kinda like a firecracker you know?   You know what? Screw that I'm going back in the house for the other can.

   Yes, I got a second can of pyrodex and dumped it too. Now we're cookin'.  I stepped back about 15 ft and lit the 2 stroke arrow. I drew the nock to my cheek and took aim. As I released I heard a clunk as the arrow launched from my bow. In a slow motion time frame, I turned to see my dad getting out of the truck... OH SHOOT! He just got home from work. So help me God it took 10 minutes for that arrow to go from my bow to the can. My dad was walking towards me in slow motion with a WTF look in his eyes. I turned back towards my target just in time to see the arrow pierce the starting fluid can right at the bottom. Right through the main pile of pyrodex and into the can. Oh shoot.

  When the shock wave hit it knocked me off my feet. I don't know if it was the actual compression wave that threw me back or just reflex jerk back from 235 fricking decibels of sound. I caught a half a millisecond glimpse of the violence during the initial explosion and I will tell you there was dust, grass, and bugs all hovering 1 ft above the ground as far as I could see. It was like a little low to the ground layer of dust fog full of grasshoppers, spiders, and a worm or two.

   The daylight turned purple. Let me repeat this... THE FRICKING DAYLIGHT TURNED PURPLE.

  There was a big sweetgum tree out by the gate going into the pasture. Notice I said ""was"". That son-of-a-bitch got up and ran off.

   So here I am, on the ground blown completely out of my shoes with my thundercats T-Shirt shredded, my dad is on the other side of the carport having what I can only assume is a Vietnam flashback: ECHO BRAVO CHARLIE YOU'RE BRINGIN' EM IN TOO CLOSE!! CEASE FIRE. DAMN IT CEASE FIRE!!!!!

   His hat has blown off and is 30 ft behind him in the driveway. All windows on the north side of the house are blown out and there is a slow rolling mushroom cloud about 2000 ft. over our backyard. There is a Honda 185 3 wheeler parked on the other side of the yard and the fenders are drooped down and are now touching the tires.

   I wish I knew what I said to my dad at this moment. I don't know - I know I said something. I couldn't hear. I couldn't hear inside my own head. I don't think he heard me either... not that it would really matter. I don't remember much from this point on. I said something, felt a sharp pain, and then woke up later. I felt a sharp pain, blacked out, woke later....repeat this process for an hour or so and you get the idea. I remember at one point my mom had to give me CPR. and Dad screaming ""Bring him back to life so I can kill him again"". Thanks Mom.

   One thing is for sure... I never had to mow around that stump again, Mom had been bitching about that thing for years and dad never did anything about it. I stepped up to the plate and handled business.

   Dad sold his muzzle loader a week or so later. I still have some sort of bone growth abnormality, either from the blast or the beating, or both.

   I guess what I'm trying to say is, get your kids into archery. It's good discipline and will teach them skills they can use later on in life.

Much of their relationship is based on pragmatism rather than real friendship or personal affection.

One day, as he drinks his morning coffee, Saul opens the morning paper and turns to the Obits page.

He gets the shock of his life when he sees his own obituary in the column.
 He realizes that the query for info on him by the local newspaper several months earlier, was in preparation for this event. He correctly surmises that it is a mistaken entry from their database, premature and erroneous.

It still excites and rankles him, so he calls Jake up. ""Jake, are you up yet?""

Jake sleepily answers, ""Yeah, but I'm only now starting my coffee.""

""Jake. open the newspaper to page 31.""

""Why, what's in the paper?""

""Jake, get the paper and open it to page 31 NOW!""

""Jake, read the story on the bottom of the column already!""

""OK, OK, I'll start reading the column if you stop yelling in my ear!""

So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.

The brown haired man laughes it off as a crazy idea, and they continue to drink. However after another half hour of heavy drinking both men are sufficiently plastered, and the blacked haired man leans in again to slur out,
""Really though man, i bet you ten bucks i can jump off that cliff and fly back to the top!""
The brown haired man is just drunk enough now to become interested, so skeptically he follows him outside. 
""Here's what I'm gonna do,"" the black haired man exclaims between burps and sways "" I'm gonna jump off that cliff, catch the air, and I'm gonna fly back up here!""
And without missing a beat, he sprints towards the edge and throws himself off as the the brown haired man looks on, horrified. Not seconds after, despite all odds, the black haired man soars back onto the cliff, coat billowing in the strong wind. 
Shocked and amazed, the brown haired man asks him to do it again, and a third time, sure enough he always ends up flying safely back to the bar.
""My god I've got to try this my self!"" screams the brown haired man, as he runs to the cliff, throws himself off, and plummets 200 feet to his death. Just as the splat is heard, the bartender comes out shaking his head at the black haired man, and says

He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. 

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. 

At this point they decided to try for 50%. 

The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. 

She and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on their porch.",13,2015-06-18

They laughed, they hit on cute girls, they partied hard. They had a final exam Monday morning, so late Sunday night they packed it up and drove home.
Monday morning rolls around, and they all sleep in, and miss the exam. When they wake up, phone calls are made, and they decide that they will tell their prof. about the weekend road trip, but tell him that they got a flat on the way home on Sunday afternoon, didn't have a spare, and could not get back in time for the exam, since there were no tire shops open to fix their flat. 
So, they all troop down to the prof's office, tell him their tale of woe, and ask to be allowed to write the exam the next day. The Prof agrees to let them, and they head home feeling pretty good.
Tuesday morning comes around, and the buddies show up for their exam. The prof sets them up in four separate study rooms, and gives them each a test. The first page is some pretty basic multiple choice questions, worth 10%. At the top of the second page it says:

“I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running, but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.”

He explains that last year two hunters convinced the pilot to carry two moose and the plane went down, killing the pilot and seriously injuring the hunters.  The two men agree to these terms and they are off.  The guide drops them off and says he'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

The men thank him for the ride and then continue on their way to find a moose.  They go looking for one, and find it with an hour.  They carefully take aim and down the moose.  Concerned that they have to wait another day for the plane to come back, the decide to continue on to find another.  They drag it back the the runway and start again.

The next morning they kill the second moose, drag it to the runway beside the first, and wait.  When the pilot returns he is concerned.  He explains that he cannot take two moose in the plane.  The two guys get angry, and tell him that they are small enough that it will be fine.

The pilot reluctantly agrees.  After they take off, the plane is obviously struggling.  They dip down slowly, and a bit more, until the wing clips a tree and they crash into the ground.  The pilot immediately dies.

One man pulls the other out to safety.

While at the fair, he met another farmer who owned five male pigs. After talking a bit, they decided to mate the pigs and split everything 50/50. As the farmers lived 60 miles from each other, they agreed to meet halfway and find a field in which to mate their pigs.

The first morning the farmer with the female pigs got up at 5 AM, loaded the pigs into the family station wagon, and drove the 30 miles. 

While the pigs were mating he asked the other farmer, “How will I know if they’re pregnant?” 

The other farmer replied, “Tomorrow morning, if they’re in the grass grazing, then they’re pregnant. If they’re in the mud, they’re not.”

The next morning they were rolling in the mud, so the farmer called the other farmer, hosed his pigs off; loaded them into the family station wagon and drove off to try again. 

The following morning, it was mud again! This continued for a week until one morning the farmer was so tired he couldn’t get out of bed.

He called out to his wife, “Honey, please look outside and tell me if the pigs are in the mud or in the field.” 

“Well, neither,” yelled his wife. “They’re all in the station wagon and one of them is honking the horn.”",15,2015-06-18

The hare, the fox and the bear turn 18 and receive their enlistment order, but don't want to serve in the military. This was back when conscientious objection was not as easy as it is nowadays.

They meet in front of the barracks and think about what to do.

The hare has to go inside first. They decide to fold one of his ears and fix them with a clothespeg (US: clothespin). The hare goes inside, and after some time, he comes back out, saying: ""Unfit to serve, because of my ear.""

The fox is next, but he does not have long ears, so they decide to fold his tail instead. They too fix it with a clothespeg. The fox goes inside, and after some time, he comes back out, saying: ""Unfit to serve, because of my tail.""

The last one to go inside is the bear, and neither does he have long ears, nor does he have a long tail. The three think about it for some time, then they decide to punch him in the face and break some teeth.

Noticing the length of her skirt and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea. ""I'd like some raisin bread please"", the man says politely. The female clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. The young man standing almost directly beneath her is provided with an excellent view, just as he surmised he would be. 




Once she descends the ladder he muses that he really should get two loaves as he's having company for dinner.

Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view. With each trip up the ladder the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon each male patron is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down. After many trips shes tired, irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try this bread for herself!



 Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd staring up at her.

Bushwacker61,"One afternoon, a Cessna landed at Area 51 |||  the US Airforce high security ""secret"" base. The aircraft was immediately impounded & the pilot was interrogated. 

 The pilot's story was that - he took off from Vegas, got lost & spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. 

 The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot & held him overnight during the investigation. 

 By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost & wasn't a spy. 

 They re fueled his airplane, threatened him that if he lands again he would spend the rest of his life in prison, and let him go. 

 The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force personnel, the same Cessna landed there again. 

 Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane ... only this time there were two people in the plane. 

 The same pilot jumped out & said:

I live by myself, and my name definitely is not Ben. It was probably a wrong number and I was bored.
“I’m sorry, he’s not in right now. Can I take a message?”
“Do you know what time he’ll be back?” she responded.
“I think he said he’d be home around 10:00.”
Silence on the other end… a confused silence.
“Is this Steve?”
My name isn’t Steve, either. This was definitely a wrong number.
“Yes, it is. Do you want to leave a message for Ben?”
“Well… he said he would be home tonight and asked me to call him…” she said in a slightly irritated voice.
I replied, “Well, he went out with Karen about an hour ago, and said that he would be back at 10:00.”
A shocked voice now: “Who’s Karen?!”
“The girl he went out with.”
“I know that! I mean… who is she?”
“I don’t know her last name. Look, do you want me to leave a message for Ben?”
“Yes… please do. Tell him to call me when he gets home.”
She was sounding pretty irate at this point, and I could hear her temper flaring. “I sure will. Is this Jennifer?”
She exploded this time. “Who’s Jennifer?”
Apparently she wasn’t.
“Well… he’s going out with Jennifer at 10:00. I thought you were her. Sorry… it was an honest mistake.”
“Ben’s the one that’s made the mistake! Tell him that Alice called him and the she’s very upset and that I would like him to call me as soon as he gets home.”

After a few drinks, the fifth is diminished and the G is out flat. An F comes in and tries to augment the situation, but is not sharp enough.

A D comes into the bar and heads straight for the bathroom saying, ""Excuse me. I'll just be a second.""

Eventually, the C sobers up, and realizes in horror that he's under a rest.

ivo09,"An attractive blonde was driving down a country road... ||| when she spotted another blonde in the middle of a wheat field, rowing a boat for all her worth.

Curious, she stopped the car, staring in disbelief as the woman pulled and sweated.

When she couldn’t stand it any more, she called-out, “Why are you rowing a boat in the middle of the field?”

Stopping her efforts for the moment, the blond in the boat responds, “Because it’s an ‘ocean’ of wheat!”

The blond standing on the side of the road is furious! She yells at the rower, “It’s blondes like you that give the rest of us a bad name!”

The woman in the boat just shrugs her shoulders and begins to row again.

Standing by her car, the woman is beside herself. She shakes her fist at the woman in the field, yelling, “If I could swim I’d come out there and kick your ass!” ",48,2015-06-19
ivo09,"A hurricane comes unexpectedly. ||| The ship goes down and is lost. A man finds himself swept up on the shore of an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing. Only bananas and coconuts. Used to five-star hotels, this guy has no idea what to do, so for the next four months he eats bananas, drinks coconut juice and longs for his old life. He fixes his gaze on the sea, hoping to spot a rescue ship.

One day, as he is lying on the beach, he spots a movement out of the corner of his eye. It's a rowboat, and in it is the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen. She rows up to him.

In disbelief, he asks her, 'Where did you come from? How did you get here?'

'I rowed from the other side of the island,' she says. 'I landed here when my cruise ship sank.'

'Amazing,' he says. 'I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many are there? You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you.'

'It's only me,' she says, 'and the rowboat didn't wash up; nothing did.'

He is confused. 'Then how did you get the rowboat?'

'Oh, simple,' replies the woman. 'I made the rowboat out of materials that I found on the island. I whittled the oars from the gumtree branches. I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides and stern came from a coconut tree.'

'B-b-but that's impossible,' stutters the man. 'You had no tools or hardware. How did you manage?'

'Oh, that was no problem,' replies the woman. 'On the other side of the island there is a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into the forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware. But enough of that,' she says. 'Where do you live?'

Sheepishly, he confesses that he has been sleeping on the beach the whole time. 

'Well, let's row over to my place then,' she says.

After a few minutes of rowing she docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to the shore he nearly falls out of the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white. While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only state ahead, dumbstruck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, 'It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down, please; would you like a drink?'

'No, no thank you,' he says, still dazed. 'I can't take any more coconut juice.'

'It's not coconut juice,' the woman replies. 'I have a still. How about a pina colada?'

Trying to hide his amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk.

After they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, 'I'm going to slip into something comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave?' There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom.'

No longer questioning anything, the man goes into the bathroom. There in the cabinet is a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened onto its end inside a swivel mechanism.

'This woman is amazing,' he muses. 'What next?'

When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines - strategically positioned - and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons him over to sit down next o her.

'Tell me,' she begins, suggestively, slithering closer to him, 'we have been out here for a very long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for all these months. You know...'

She stares into his eyes. He can't believe what he is hearing.

There were two white christian men, John and Mike, whose plane crashed into a desert. Luckily they survived unharmed. As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.
As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.
So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.
John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.
The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.
Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)

Sariusmonk,"Documentary Crew on a Cannibal Island ||| A documentary crew of three guys explore an island and stumble across some natives. The natives turn out to be cannibals and the three guys get captured and tied up.

They are each given an option;

""You can either complete our two trials, fail and we'll kill you and eat you or don't take part in the trials and we'll kill you and eat you right now.""

All three decided the trials were a better option. 

""So what is the first trial?"" one said.

""Go into the forest and gather 10 of the same kind of fruit then return"" said the Chief.

""Easy enough"" said the men and were escorted into the forest to gather fruit.

The first of the three men chose to gather apples and it did not take him too long so he returned promptly.

""What is the next trial?"" he asked the Chief.

""Now take those 10 fruit, insert them into your anus and do not make any noise, fail and be eaten.""

Shocked but with no option the man began to insert apples into his anus. After the third apple he couldn't help but wince in pain. He was killed and thrown into a cooking pot.

The second of the men returned having gathered 10 small berries off the ground. He too was told the second trial required inserting them into his anus without making a sound.

Easily enough the berries went in. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. And on the 9th berry the man burst out into laughter, was killed and thrown into the pot.

At the gates of heaven, the first guy observed what had just happened and when his friend joined him to enter the pearly gates he had to ask;

""You had 9 berries in your anus then burst out laughing! You were nearly free! Why did you laugh?""

To which the other guy responded;

""I just saw our friend coming out of the forest carrying pineapples.""",8,2015-06-19

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking.  How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

So God agreed......
On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh.  For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years?  That's a pretty long time to perform.  How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family.  For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years.  How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again......
On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.  For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years?  Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God.  ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.  For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.  For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren.  And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

EA7_THI5,"The rabbit, the bear, and the wish granting frog (My first post, please be gentle) |||   A rabbit was sitting in the forest straining to expel the demons caused from a bad meal he had eaten the night before, when he heard a rustling in the bush not far from him. Knowing he was near the bottom of the food chain, he tried to hurry it up.

  Just as the rabbit finished his business, a bear stuck his head through the bush and immediately saw him. Both of them were off like lightening, the rabbit trying to save his fur and the bear trying to land an 'easy meal'. Through the forest the rabbit ran, darting left and dodging right with the bear close in tow at every turn. As the bear closed the gap and started closing in to catch his meal, they ran into an open field and bounded over a slender creek. No sooner were they over the creek when they heard a deep and throaty ""STOP!!""

  Not used to hearing such a sound, they both come to a screeching halt, tumbling over each other. On the bank of the creek was the largest bull frog either of them had ever seen.

  The frog spoke again and said ""You two are pretty loud, running around. Normally I would be annoyed because I was napping in the sun, but you two saved my life from the hawk that was going to snatch me by waking me up.""

  ""Umm...your welcome?"" uttered the bear, keeping an eye on what would still hopefully be his next meal. 

  ""It just so happens I am a wish granting genie and while I am on hiatus, I feel I owe you both for saving my life. I will grant you both three wishes, in succession of course, as a means of gratitude. Ok, who is going first?""

  The bear, unable to contain his excitement, jumped in front of the rabbit and managed to yelp out ""ME, ME!!"" 

  ""Ok bear, what will it be?""

  ""Mating season is tough, with all the competition. I think if you could make all the bears in this forest female, except for me, that would make things easier.""

  ""Done,"" claimed the frog. ""Now rabbit, what can I grant for you?""

  ""I want a helmet,"" he stated, matter-of-factly. The frog, having heard very odd requests in his time, granted the wish with barely a second thought.

  ""Ok bear, time for your second wish. What will it be?"".

  ""Oh man, I thought about it and realized it would be easier if all the bears in the surrounding forests where female too!"" he exclaimed.

  ""Nice wish,"" and with that, the frog made it so. He turned back to the rabbit, asking ""what is your next wish?""

  ""I want a motorcycle."" The frog and the bear looked at each other and exchanged a 'WTF' look. True to his word though, the frog granted the outlandish wish.

  ""Alright bear, you have been on a roll today. What is your last wish?""

  ""Wow, I feel like I wasted my first two but this last one will make up for it. I WISH ALL THE BEARS IN THE WORLD WERE FEMALE!...except for me of course.""

  With the same amount of fervor and excitement the frog exclaimed ""DONE!"" Looking back to the rabbit, feeling a bit annoyed, the frog asked ""What else could you possibly want?"" 

   The rabbit strapped on his helmet, jumped on the motorcycle, looked straight in the bears face and yelled ""I WISH THE BEAR WAS GAY!"" and was out of sight before either of them knew what had happened.

Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts. Well, after another beer, and some heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with the answer to that question.
Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; and here is the reason for my conclusion.
A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""

Days after the surgery, the rich man hands his friend an envelope. Eagerly, he opens it. What he finds is a $50 gift card to a local restaurant.

Bushwacker61,"It started out innocently enough. |||  I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.

I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.

I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.

I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?""

Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.

I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, ""Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about.

I came home early after my conversation with the boss. ""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking...""

""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!""

""But Honey, surely it's not that serious.""

""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!""

""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door.

I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed.

To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.

As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.

Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.

I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking. 

And today I joined the Democratic party!

""Well,"" Dad says, ""Think of it this way. I'm the president, Mom is the Congress, our maid is the work force, and your little brother is the rest of the citizens in the United States.""

""I don't think I get it,"" says Little Johnny, thinking about this observation.

""Why don't you sleep on it, then?"" Dad says. Little Johnny nods his little curious head, wishes Dad goodnight, and heads to bed.

Around 1:00 A.M., Little Johnny hears a lamp fall over. Unable to sleep from the frighteningly sudden noise, he goes to his little brother's room to see what's going on.

The small child is lying in his crib, and apparently, he knocked over a lamp, which was shattered all over the floor. ""Oh dear,"" says Little Johnny, when he sees that his little brother crapped his diaper. He decides to go get Dad.

Little Johnny runs to his parents' large bedroom. He creaks open the door, and sees Mom sleeping, but no Dad! Little Johnny exits to find Dad, searching more of his large house. Eventually, he makes it to their maid's bedroom. Looking through the keyhole, he sees Dad ""doing"" the maid. She seems to enjoy it.

Little Johnny jumps into the air in delight. ""Now I get it,"" he yells happily, ""So the Congress is asleep, the President is screwing the Work Force, AND THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE FULL OF SH*T!!""",30,2015-06-21

Man asked the guide why? 


Guide: Give him something to eat.


Man gave him a peanut, monkey took the peanut, shove it in its ass and then ate it.


Man: what is so intelligent in it?



Guide: Months ago, an Englishman came here, gave him a mango, this fucker swallowed it whole, the seed got struck in his ass, he had problems getting it out so now first he checks if it will get out easily and then eats it.


Man: Cool




The man visits the same zoo after months only to find that a ""Super Intelligent monkey"" was written over the cage of that monkey.





Man: What now, how is he super intelligent now?



Guide: Give him something to eat.



Man gave him a grape, monkey took the grape, dipped it into a water bowl, shoved into his ass and then ate it.


Man: How does that make him superintelligent?



Guide: That Englishman returned last month, saw this monkey, only this time he handed him a lighted CIGARETTE.

Morocco_Llama,"Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger ||| So one day, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were sitting together in a bar, kicking back, drinking a few brews, talking about life and talking about the roles they'd played in movies.

As the three men talked, each was surprised to realize that all three of them had grown tired of playing the action hero- shooting the bad guys, pulling off life-threatening stunts, and getting the girl in the end.  The whole scene was just all played out for them.

By chance, Stallone had with him a script that his agent had given to him kind of as a joke.  The script would allow three actors to act out the role of their favorite musical composer.  The three men were delighted, ""This is great! Nobody would ever expect this from us! Let's do it!""  And so the agreement was made. Soon, a big budget studio was attached to the project, Spielberg signed on to direct, everything was falling into place.

On the day of the first pre-production meeting, the actors realized they needed to pick parts. Since Stallone had proposed the idea, he got to choose first.  After thinking for a minute, he declared ""I want to be Beethoven."" The others agreed to let Stallone have Beethoven.

Next, it was Van Dam's turn.  He thought for a moment, then declared, ""I want to play Mozart."" And the others agreed to that as well.

Finally, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's turn.  After thinking about it for several moments, Schwarzenegger finally declared, *cue Terminator voice*: ""I'll be Bach.""",172,2015-06-21

 God created the dog and said, ""Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""So God agreed.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""
The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""And God agreed.

On the third day, God created the cow and said,  ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""
The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""
And God agreed again. 

On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""
But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and it was like pure Almond Joy!

I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds because it was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots.

It was all I could do to hold the Snickers and Crackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream ""Oh Henry, Oh Henry!""

Soon she was fondling my Peter Pan and ZagNut and I knew it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milk Duds clear to Mars that gave her a taste of the old Milky Way.

She asked me if I was into M&M, but I said, ""Hey Chicklet, no kinky stuff."" I said, ""Look you little Reese's Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why don't you take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit 'O' Honey?""

(What a piece of Juicy Fruit she was, too!)

She screamed, ""Oh Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!"" as I rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup.

Well, I was giving it to her Good 'N' Plenty, when all the sudden... my Starburst!

Patricia is a little bemused, as it is a frog asking for a loan, but she is a polite lady and so continues with the usual procedure: ""We will need some form of collateral in order to issue you with a loan"" The frog replies ""I thought you might say that so I have brought something with me"" and hands Patricia a small, pink, shiny porcelain elephant.

The frog appears mildly frustrated: ""Come on, my father is Mick Jagger and all I want is a £10,000 loan.""

She gives him the key and the man rushes to take care of business. After finishing he notices there's no toilet paper around and nothing else to wipe with. Then he spots a sign on the wall that reads ""Use your fingers to wipe yourself then put them in the hole in the wall to have them licked clean."". He sees some light come out to notice that the hole is right behind the counter with the hot blonde! The man in disbelief says ""no way she would ever do that!"".

Five, ten, twenty minutes pass since he went and sitting there with his pants on the floor, sweating from the heat and cant find any other options the man says ""damn it, i got no other choice"" and starts to clean himself. After finishing he cautiously and slowly put his hand through the hole and waits. On the other side of the wall the blonde spots the hand and with a brick in each hand she SMASHES his hand and the mans quickly, without missing a beat, pulls his hand out of the wall, screams in pain and sticks his fingers in his mouth.

So Sam came back in four hours and the surgeon said, ""I got done

Sam went to the pub and was amazed to see John throwing darts. ""Wow"" thought Sam,"" that surgeon does excellent work""

A few weeks later, Sam and John were out again, and John accidentally cut his leg off. Sam put the leg in a plastic bag and took it, and John, back to the same surgeon.

The surgeon said, ""Legs are a little tougher, but I'll see what I can
do - come back in six hours.""

Sam returned in six hours and the surgeon said, ""I finished early -
John's down at the soccer field.""

Sam went to the soccer field and there was John, kicking goals. ""Wow"" thought Sam ""That surgeon is amazing""

A few weeks later, John had a terrible accident and cut his head off.

Sam put the head in a plastic bag and took it and the rest of John to the surgeon.

twelve times.

On their wedding night they settle into the bridal suite at their
hotel and the bride says to her new groom, ""Please promise to be
gentle,... I am still a virgin.""

This puzzled the groom, since after twelve marriages he thought that at least one of her husbands would have been able to perform. He asked his new bride to explain the phenomena.

The bride responds...

""My first husband was a Sales Representative who spent our entire
marriage telling me, in grandiose terms, ""It's gonna be great!""

My second husband was from Software Services; he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he would send me documentation.

My third husband was from Field Services who constantly said that
everything was diagnostically ""okay,"" but he just couldn't get the
system up.

My fourth husband was from Educational Services, and he simply said, ""Those who can... do; those who can't... teach.""

My fifth husband was from the Telemarketing Department who said that he had the orders, but he wasn't quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver.

My sixth husband was an Engineer. He told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

My seventh husband was from Finance And Administration. His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn't sure whether or not it was his job.

My eighth husband was from Standards And Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it.

My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, ""I know I have the product, I'm just not sure how to position it!""

My tenth husband was a psychiatrist and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it.

My eleventh husband was a gynecologist and all he ever wanted to do was look at it.

My twelfth husband was a stamp collector and all he ever wanted to do was... God I miss him!

So now I have married a lawyer, I know I'm really going to get screwed.

As he settles in, he glances up and sees a stunningly beautiful and very sexy woman boarding the plane. He soon realizes she is heading straight towards him. A wave of nervous anticipation washes over him. Lo and behold, she takes the seat right next to him.  
Anxious to strike up a conversation, he blurts out, “So, are you going to Vegas to try your luck?”
She turns and smiles, and says, “Well no, I'm going to the Adult Entertainment Expo.  I guess you could say I'm a movie star. ”
He swallows hard, and is instantly crazed with excitement. Here’s the most sensuous woman he has ever seen, sitting right next to him, going to Vegas, and obviously she’s a porn queen. Struggling to maintain his outward cool, he asks with some awkwardness, ""Oh, I see . . . so tell me, is it true that Italian men make the best lovers?""
The woman blushes.  ""Well no, that would be Jewish men.  They are very romantic and gentle.""
Disappointed but emboldened, Tony then asks, ""Well, I've heard that Italian men are the most well-endowed.""
The woman smiles.  ""I'm afraid that's wrong.  In fact, they tend to be rather, well . . . small.  Native American men are most likely to be big.""
Suddenly, the woman looks slightly embarrassed. “I’m sorry,” she says, “I feel so awkward discussing these things with you, and I don’t even know your name.”
Tony extends his hand and replies, “Tonto. Tonto Rosenberg.”

During the course of the meal, his mother couldn’t help but notice how beautiful his roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious….

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom’s thoughts, his son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you,we are just roommates.”

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I’ve been unable to find the silver plate. You don’t suppose she took it, do you?”

He said ,”Well, I doubt it, but I’ll email her,  just to be sure.” He sat down and wrote….

Dear Mother:
I’m not saying that you ‘did’ take the silver plate from my house, I’m not saying that you ‘did not’ take the silver plate, but the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.
Love,
Your Son

Several days later, he received an email from his Mother which read:

Dear Son:
I’m not saying that you ‘do’ sleep with your roommate, and I’m not saying that you ‘do not’ sleep with her, but the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under her pillow…

""What's The Secret?""  The man asks.  His curiosity is piqued, you see.  ""You'll have to find out,"" she says.  What the hell, he thinks.  ""Ok, let me have The Secret.""  She takes him to the champagne room, and says, ""There's one rule.  The lights have to be out.""  OK, he thinks.  And she turns the light out.  A few seconds go by, and he feels her start to give him a blowjob.  Feels like a normal blowjob, he thinks.  But then...

The stripper starts singing!  Full on opera, while she's blowing him.  How is she doing this?  He finishes, she turns the light on, and he says ""how'd you do that?""  The stripper smiles coyly and says, ""That's The Secret!""

The man leaves.  How did she do it?  The question gnaws at him.  The next evening, he returns.  He tracks her down, and says, ""I want The Secret again.""  Same story-- this time, however, she sings ""What does the Fox say?""  Distracting choice of song, but still doesn't answer the question.  The light goes on, he offers to give he another $200 for the answer.  ""My little secret!"" The stripper says.

Now the man is angry.  he's being made a fool, he thinks to himself.  So he goes back the next day, angrily hands her $200, and says ""The Secret!""  Back to the room they go.  But he has a plan this time, you see.  Same story- lights go off, she starts blowing him, and she starts singing Moon River.  As soon as she starts, though, he flips the light on.

SeeminglyRacist,"An old man lives in a retirement home... ||| An old man lives in a retirement home and realizes that he has only but a few years left to live. In the retirement home, all the other senior citizens realize they share the same fate. 

So, without much care, everyone is sexually active. Because they are old and close to death, they see no need to wear condoms and the home doesn't provide them. Eventually, STDs run rampant in the retirement home. 

The old man doesn't want to live with the discomfort of STDs, but he still wants to be sexually active like everybody else. He meets this nice old lady who seems to fancy him. So, to limit the risk of spreading a disease she satisfies him with handjobs. 

Unfortunately, she can't stroke his member because of the painful arthritis in her wrists, so she just sits there and holds his dong. The old man didn't seem to mind. After all, she was the prettiest woman in the retirement home, and he wasn't getting any diseases. 

But one day the nice old lady walks into the old man's room and catches him with another woman. She felt very betrayed. 

""How could you?! What does she have that I don't?!"", she exclaims.

""I'm sorry sweetheart, but she has Parkinson's.""

gamerporcupine,"Girlfriend's hot sister ||| I was happy, my girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend - she was a dream! 

There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 

One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. 

She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. 

I walked straight towards my car, My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.""

Swallowing hard, he asked, “What’s the good news?”
The trooper continued, “When we pulled her up, she had 12

AnticitizenPrime,"The Brass Rat ||| A man, visiting San Francisco, noticed a musty curio shop, which seemed to be forgotten by time. It seemed very out of place in the busy city. The man's curiosity was piqued, and he entered the shop. The store didn't seem to have much traffic, and the shelves were full of dusty, but interesting items. The man found himself strangely interested in a rather ugly brass rat on a shelf behind the counter. Ugly it was, but he had never seen anything like it -- it was so incredibly detailed, and life-like. He asked the shopkeeper for a price.

The man was pleased to learn that he could acquire the rat for only $5, and he handed the shopkeeper the money. But, before giving the man the rat, the shopkeeper sternly warned him, ""This sale is final. If you leave the shop with the brass rat, I won't take it back under any circumstances.""

The man thought the warning was curious, given that the rat only cost $5. Even if he decided he hated the rat, that was hardly an amount worth worrying about. He agreed to the shopkeeper's terms, and left with the rat.

At first, everything seemed perfectly normal. But as he walked back toward his car, the man started to hear strange rustling noises around him. Then he saw a life rat scurry out of an alley, and start to follow him. Suddenly, rats seemed to be appearing all around him, streaming out of sewers and dumpsters, all following him and milling about his feet.

The man began to run, but the rats kept up in increasing numbers. The man realized that he was being chased by literally tens of thousands of rats. The ground came alive, as the rats swarmed behind him.

The man suddenly realized the significance of the shopkeeper's warning, and knew what he had to do. He turned toward the bay, and ran as quickly as he could toward the water. When he reached the waterfront, he threw the brass rat as far as he could into the bay. The rats raced past him, following the brass rat into the water, where they drowned.

The man returned to the curio shop, and upon seeing him enter the shopkeeper shouted, ""I told you, no refunds. I don't want trouble here. The sale was final, and you can't return the merchandise.""

The man smiled, and replied, ""Oh, I don't want to return the rat. I just want to know -- do you have any brass lawyers?""",6,2015-06-07

When asked what he'd like for his last meal, he replied simply with ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

However, after the electricity was activated, nothing happened to the conductor. The prison guard was shocked and, not knowing what to do, simply let him go unscathed. 

In a few days, the conductor was back to work. A few days after his return to the train business, he managed to derail yet another train, again killing nearly a hundred people but surviving the crash. As before, he was trialed and found guilty of mass murder. Again, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.

It was the same prison guard as before. He was surprised to see the conductor again but held his tongue, for the man was about to die and it would be rude to question him.
""What would you like for your last meal, sir?"" The conductor respond as he did last time: ""A banana, if you will."" The prison guard shrugged, got a banana, and gave it to the poor man. The conductor ate the banana in regular fashion and braced himself for death. He was seated on the chair, fastened in, and was ready for what was about to happen.

The electricity was activated and the conductor was prepared. But, as before, the conductor was unhurt. The prison guard checked for any malfunctions but found nothing, not believing the entire situation was possible. In shock as before and not knowing what to do, the guard let the conductor go.

The conductor was, against all odds, alive and was still allowed to continue his job as a train conductor even though he was responsible for the death of almost two hundred people.

He was thankful to be allowed to continue his job but also scared. He would try not carefully from now on. However, this idea didn't help much as on the first train he was conducting after the chair, he managed to somehow crash yet another train. He was the only survivor of the train, which contained over a hundred people. He was trialed and, again, found guilty of the murder of over a hundred people. He was sentenced to death by electric chair.

The prison guard was the same, the surprise was the same, the procedure was the same. After giving the banana to the conductor, the guard was silent. He couldn't bring himself to say anything, all he could do was prepare the chair.

The man sat in the chair, expecting death. The guard activated it and, again, the conductor was unscathed. The prison guard couldn't contain himself. He simply had to ask, ""Sir, how did you manage to crash a train 3 times? And how did you survive the chair 3 times? Did the banana have something to do with it?"" The conductor responds with: ""No, I suppose I'm just not a good conductor.""",475,2015-06-07

Fast forward to about 16 years later:

One day the woman was in her bedroom folding laundry when all of a sudden one of her daughters runs into the room crying profusely. 

""What happened??"" asked the mother.

The daughter replied, ""Well I was peeing and all of a sudden I felt a lot of pressure and then a bullet came out.""

The mother thought for a moment, shocked, and then replied, ""Well honey, I'm almost done folding laundry so as soon as I'm done I'll take you into the doctor.""

The daughter walked out as the mother continued to fold her laundry when all of a sudden her second daughter walks into the room bawling her eyes out, ""Mom! Mom! Something horrible just happened! I was peeing and a bullet came out!""

Now the mother was very confused. ""Well I'll take you and your sister to the emergency room in just a moment, I only have a few more shirts to fold.""

The second daughter left the room as the mother continued to fold the laundry. As she gets to the last shirt her son busts into the room, laughing so hard that he is nearly in tears. The son then says, ""Mom, you'll never guess what just happened to me.""

The mother replies, ""What, were you peeing and a bullet came out?""

The woman walks to him and says ""okay, I'll bite, what makes that beer so magic."" The man stands up, takes a huge gulp, jumps out the window and flys around the builiding and back through the window. The woman is amazed and demands he do it again, so he does.

I've suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs...phone rings, but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently, although when I ask their names she always says, ""Just some friends from work, you don't know them.""

I sometimes stay awake to look out for her cab coming home, but she always comes walking up the drive as I hear the sound of a car leaving, around the corner, as if she has gotten out and walked the rest of the way. Why? Maybe she wasn't in a taxi at all?

I once picked up her cell phone, just to see what time it was. This caused her to go completely berserk. She quickly snatched the phone out of my hand and cursed me hysterically, screaming that I should never touch her personal property, then accused me of trying to spy on her.

Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her. I decided I was going to park my Harley Davidson Lowrider next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the street around the corner when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my motorcycle that I noticed a small amount of motor oil leaking through the gasket between the rear head and rocker arm cover.

Earlier this year, a Chinese family moved into my small town. The family had two twins who were both seniors in my class, Ving and Ling. Ving and his sister Ling were quiet to start off with, but eventually I made good friends with Ving. After talking to him for a few weeks he revealed to me that he absolutely abhored his name, and that he'd do almost anything to figure out how to get it changed. I asked him what he wanted to change it to, and he said

""lee, like bruce lee or some shit.""

I was failing trigonometry at the time, and so I thought what the hell, and offered to help him in exchange for him doing my homework. Ling overheard us and chimed in,

""If you do that, father will disown you as our child. That name has been in our family line for generations.""

Ving never really listened to his sister though, and he still wanted to go through with the plan. The next day after school, I drove him to the town hall. After we arrived, he had gotten the name-change sheet and was scribbling down information on to it when I saw his face change. I could tell he was extremely conflicted with his choice. Tears began to stream down his face. He finally decided that he was gonna have to cancel his request, and Ling looked relieved. The receptionist let us know that there would be a cancelation fee, and handed the fee waiver to her. Suddenly, a short asian man with neon shorts, ray-bans, and an american flag t-shirt bursted into the room. Ving turned in awe and stared at the man, as tears rolled down his cheeks.

""D-D-Dad?""

With a huge smile on his face, the man ran up and embraced his son.

""No way, it'll take me two weeks to get there and back! You'll start the food without me and it'll be gone when I'm back!"" he says.

After assuring him they won't touch the food until he returns, he goes off on his way. 2 weeks later and the Tortoise family are getting hungry but there's no sign of Uncle Tortoise.

The first blonde pitches to the other the idea of starting a real farm, with a bull as their first animal, for which to plow the fields they're sure to own.

The second blonde enjoys the idea, but mentions she can't leave also to go in search for a bull for financial reasons, having to save up  money to be able to purchase the farm. However, she gives the first blonde $500 dollars to buy the bull, confident it will be enough money.

So the first blonde sets off for the country and happens upon a farm selling exactly what she is looking for.

She asks the nice woman how much the bull will cost and the woman says, ""$499, final offer.""

Ecstatic, the blonde hands over the $500 and is returned $1 exactly. 

She realizes that having a bull in tow, on route home, would prove more difficult than traveling alone to the country. This was a time before cell phones and she was at a loss of what to do.

She manages to find a post office and wants to send her fellow blonde a letter. She asks how much a letter to the city would be, and the clerk says, ""It's free but I charge a dollar a word, sweety.""

The rich man would say something to her, and she would smile and give the rich man her number. 

Eventually, the beggar got tired of this. He asked the rich man what his trick was. The rich man said, ""It's simple. All you have to do is mumble, 'Tickle your ass with a feather.' When she asks you what you said, all you have to say is, 'Typically nasty weather.' She will think you're clever!"" The beggar liked this tactic and decided to use it.

Then next morning, a lady walked by the bus stop. The rich man looked at the beggar and nodded. The beggar approached the lady and said, ""Shove a feather up your ass!""

to 100%.

He opens the door, and what does he see, but his father, who had also come home for lunch, sipped naked, on top of his mother, also naked, heavily into the act of lovemaking. Not wanting to traumatize the boy, the parents continue as if nothing was wrong. Mikey watches, and after a couple of minutes asks, ""Daddy, can I climb on and have a horsy ride?"" ""Of course, Son, we're a family."" So Mikey climbs on and after a few more minutes his mother starts moaning and writhing wildly.

A week later, the Post Office receives another letter from the young boy. ""Dear Santa, Thank you so so much for the £50, but I thought you should know, those robbing bastards at the Post Office stole £5.""",50,2015-06-09

custardad,"So we had this dog named Barney.... ||| It was my first dog, got him when I was about 2, already full grown, and so by the time I was 10 or so he was getting fairly long in the tooth.  Ever the docile creature, we thought it would be best to get a new puppy to help put some spry back into those old bones.  So we get a real bouncy young pup and name it Barney Jr., like on the TV show; BJ.  

So naturally, eventually that little rascal escapes and takes off running, out into the suburban jungle of our little cul-de-sac, and my mom has to go out looking for him.  He was a good dog, and he had been trained, so she would call out as she drove around in her car: ""BJ!  Come and get it!  Come and get it, BJ!""

Now, she found that dog pretty shortly, and gets back home, but when she does, wouldn't you believe it:  There's a line at my front door about as long as the block, and every dad in the neighborhood is patiently waiting.  ",1,2015-06-09

He looks in his mirror again expecting the old man to be left behind but to his utter amazement the old man is still close behind and gaining!!

The weather was rustling outside and what heat was in the fireplace could just barely hold up against all the creaks and leaks in the house. The young man politely asked the rabbi if he wanted some more hot soup. The rabbi nodded his head and tok another plate of hot soup. He turned to the dog and asked him if he wanted a little taste. The dog nodded his head and took a big gulp of the soup. The rabbi started eating what was left and said to the young man ""So... young one. What is your profession?"". The young man pushed back his chair, stood up and replied ""I am a mason and damn proud of it!"". The rabbi gave a condescending shrug and went back to finishing his soup. Just as the soup was finished a young, pretty woman came in the door. She looked a bit pale and the rabbi asked her ""Good day young lady. What seems to be the problem?"". The young lady stumbled somewhat and whispered ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I was not expecting a rabbi and a dog in here"". To which the rabbi quickly replied ""Oh, do not be afraid. I'm just a humble rabbi. I mean you no harm, As for the dog, you would have to ask him yourself."". The dog sat up and gave the girl his attention. ""Hello, dog. What are you here then?"" the woman asked. The rabbi started laughing ""Hehehe, young lady. This is a dog. He cannot speak! Tell me. What is your profession?"". The young lady pulled out a chair, firmly sat down and loudly proclaimed ""Me?! I'm a hooker!"". The man, the dog and the rabbi. all jumped in their seats with shock. To avoid the awkward silence, the man quickly asked ""soo... how much do you make doing... that?"", realising he just made the situation much worse. He quickly followed up by offering her some hot soup to which she kindly agreed. Midday turned into evening and soon everyone got along. The young man had been wondering about this for some time now, so he decided to ask the rabbi ""So, mr rabbi, sir. Have you always been a rabbi. What was your profession before becoming a rabbi?"".

A cruise ship hired a magician to entertain the passengers. Since the passengers changed every four or five days, the magician was able to perform the same tricks over and over. 

Unfortunately, the Captain of the ship had a parrot who sat around and watched the magician perform his tricks, over and over. Eventually, the parrot learned how the tricks were done and would interrupt the act. 

""It's in his sleeve,"" the parrot would say. ""He switched balls."" ""It's in his pocket."" Etc., etc. 

Naturally, the magician was quite disturbed by the parrot but could do nothing about it, since it belonged to the Captain. 

Unfortunately, the cruise ship had the misfortune of hitting an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the sea in a matter of minutes. As fate would have it, the magician and the parrot managed to grab hold of the same floating piece of furniture. 

For 3 days, neither said anything. The magician stared at the parrot and the parrot stared back. Finally, on the 4th day, the parrot cracked and said, ""OK, I give up, where on Earth did you put the ship?""

You know, confession is good for the soul, and we'd surely build mutual tolerance, knowing what faults we all share.  How about it?""

A fleeing Taliban terrorist, desperate for water, was plodding through the Afghan desert when he saw something
far off in the distance. Hoping to find water, he hurried toward the mirage, only to find a very frail little Jewish man
standing at a small makeshift display rack selling ties.

The Taliban terrorist asked, ""Do you have water?""

The old man replied, ""I have no water. Would like to buy a tie? They are only $5.""

The Taliban shouted hysterically, ""Idiot Infidel! I do not need such an overpriced western adornment. 
I spit on your ties. I need water!""

""Sorry, I have none, just ties - pure silk, and only $5.""

""Pahh! A curse on your ties! I should wrap one around your scrawny little neck and choke the life out of you,
but I must conserve my energy and find water!""

""Okay,"" said the little old Jewish man. ""It does not matter that you do not want to buy a tie from me,
or that you hate me, threaten my life, and call me Infidel. I will show you that I am bigger than any of that. 
If you continue over that hill to the east for about two miles, you will find a restaurant. It has the finest food
and all the ice-cold water you need. Go in peace.""

 A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, 
 To everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. 
 However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. 
 By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. 
 MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if 
 There was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills Versus car kills. 
 He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat road Kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to Warn of impending danger. 
 They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck.""

The next day is his Wife's birthday, so he takes her to a nice restaurant, along with his kids and Mother-in-Law. As they are driving there he suddenly has to slam his breaks to avoid a collision. As he does so something rolls up and hits his foot from behind. It's a woman's shoe!

Realising he has left evidence from the night before in the car, the man has to think fast. ""Hey look is that Johnny Depp!?!"" he yells out and points to his right. Everyone in the car looks and starts asking where. As they do so, he quickly grabs the shoe and throws it out the window.

""WHAT YOU WAN' ROUND EYE""

Shocked that the old man spoke english, the traveler told him about his dilemma and through some slight coaxing, was invited inside. The old man and his daughter were sitting down to eat. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. The old man saw the traveler staring and whacked him with a spoon.

""YOU MAY BE GUEST, BUT YOU SEX MY DAUGHTER I GIVE YOU THE THREE ANCIENT TORTURE""

The traveler promised not to even glance at the girl. And off to bed he went in the guest room at the very top of the tower. Low and behold, 4 hours later the daughter was crawling into bed with him. ""What the hell"" he thought. And they made passionate love.

The next morning the traveler woke up with a heavy feeling on his chest. He opened his eyes and saw a rock with a not on it. ""TORTURE 1: ROCK ON CHEST"". The traveler laughed. the stupid old man calls THIS torture? He would gladly take on these three tortures if they were all this silly. So he stood up and decided to throw the rock out the window, as it was heavy and he didn't want to carry it down stairs. Or leave it in the room and leave in shame.

Out the window the rock went. The traveler then felt something odd. Something was crawling up his thigh...
He noticed another note dragging across the floor, attached to some thin piano wire, towards him. The not said in large, bold print,  ""TORTURE 2: LEFT TESTICLE TIED TO ROCK""

Thinking quickly the traveler jumped out the window. Broken bones sounded better than castration. While falling he saw the old man grinning in the courtyard below. He held a sign over his head that read ""TORTURE 3: RIGHT TESTICLE TIED TO BED POST"". ",112,2015-06-10

doomsdaydefense,"So I was filling up at the gas station the other day.. ||| ... and a young man pulled up in front of me in one of those old, built-like-a-tank F-150's. Now this young man had what I would call a trailer-park demeanor. He looked from side to side as he approached the pump, spitting chew out onto the ground as he wiped his trucker cap across the shoulder of a ratty t-shirt. He looked back at me once with a big evil grin, showing yellow teeth and a scar on his upper lip. 

He looked back at the pump and started to mutter some nonsense in hillbilly-NASCAR speak; apparently he did not find the price of gasoline agreeable. Cursing to himself, the young man began to fill up his tank with gas. All the while, this man continued to speak to himself under his breath - it was at this point that I transitioned from curious to worried, as even the normal words this man was using made little sense when put together. Needless to say, I had gotten the slowest pump and was going nowhere until it finished glugging the gas into my car.

The young redneck was more fortunate than I or just cheaper, and reached to pull out the gas handle - unfortunately, he failed to release the trigger on the handle, and gasoline came spilling out all over the side of his truck and the redneck himself. 

The cussing began in earnest at this point. He yelled a loud ""FUCK THIS HERE KAMA-SUTRA BULLSHIT"", which I still don't know the meaning of, save that this man was angry. The redneck marched away from the pump and into the convenience store, where he appeared to belligerently berate the poor Pakistani attendant. This went on for some time, and I had finally finished pumping my gas when the redneck returned in vitriolic fashion to his truck, swearing again under his breath; this time about some Ay-Rab Jew mongrel and something about hooker tits. 

Feeling that the best of the show was over, I finally got in my car to leave. Just as I buckled up, I noticed that the redneck had lit a cigarette next to his truck. I quickly fumbled for my keys - I was not going to be brought to the gates of hell alongside this moron, and sure enough the young man flicked his cigarette on the ground.

The flame lashed up his gas-stained jeans and shirt as soon as the ember touched the soiled concrete. He had not spilled much on his clothes; the majority of the gas had apparently spilled onto his arm and hand. The man raised his arm in terror, shrieking as it was fully engulfed in flame. I was frozen in shock, and before I could recover from my cowardice a police officer raced passed my car and dragged the man away from the gas pumps. He quickly made the man roll on the ground and the fire was out before it could spread to the man's face, or worse, the rest of us in the gas station parking lot.

The officer walked over to me and several other witnesses, and he asked us to stick around to give a testimony over what happened. I did so, and told him just what I've said here - minus the mongrel and hooker tits stuff. 

The officer released us and I was just about to go when I saw that he was writing the redneck a ticket. I have to admit - I was curious. I politely walked back up to the officer and asked, ""Excuse me sir, it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but notice that you were writing this man a ticket. Given that he just went through a such a terrifying experience, do you mind me asking what he did to deserve a ticket?""

The officer apparently didn't mind me asking at all. ""I don't like to do it son, but the law is the law. You can't just go around anywhere waving a firearm.""

Transphobia is ethimologically the term of having an irrational fear of transgender people, but is widly used to caracterise all discrimination of transgender people. To understand it, we need to first understand who are trans people.


**First part : Who are transgender people.**


To understand that transgender have the same right and be treated as equals, it is first important to understand who they are and not just limit oneself to the clichés that are propaged by our popular culture : Transgender actually cover many situation related to one's gender identity or gender expression. While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. 


Transsexual people identify as a member of the sex opposite to that assigned at birth, and desire to live and be accepted as such
Transsexual people may undergo gender transition, the process of aligning one's gender expression or presentation with their internal gender identity. People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer, but simply as a man or a woman. Those who continue identifying as transsexual men or women may not want to ignore their pre-transition life, and may continue strong ties with other trans people and raising social consciousness.
The process of transition may involve some kind of medical gender reassignment therapy and often (but not always) includes hormone replacement therapy or sex reassignment surgery. References to ""pre-operative"", ""post-operative"" and ""non-operative"" transsexual people indicate whether they have had, or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery, although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity.


*Transvestite or cross-dresser*


A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes of the opposite sex The term ""transvestite"" is used as a synonym for the term ""cross-dresser"", although ""cross-dresser"" is generally considered the preferred term. The term 'cross-dresser' is not exactly defined in the relevant literature. Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, offers this definition: ""[A cross-dresser] is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to [that] sex, but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of the opposite sex."" This definition excludes people ""who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons,"" such as ""those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers."" Cross-dressers may not identify with, or want to be the opposite gender, nor adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender, and generally do not want to change their bodies medically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as heterosexual People who cross-dress in public can have a desire to pass as the opposite gender, so as not to be detected as a cross-dresser, or may be indifferent.
The term ""transvestite"" and the associated outdated term ""transvestism"" are conceptually different from the term ""transvestic fetishism"", as ""transvestic fetishist"" describes those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes. In medical terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by use of the separate codes


*Genderqueer*


Genderqueer is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts, and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations. One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male, sometimes female, but whose gender identity is female, gender expression is butch, and sexual orientation is lesbian. It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes, conjoining both gender and sexuality,[55] and challenges existing constructions and identities.[56] In the binary sex/gender system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.


*Androgyne*


An androgyne is a person who cannot be classified into the typical gender roles of their society; androgyny is independent of orientation. Androgynes may identify as beyond gender, between genders, moving across genders, entirely genderless, or any or all of these, exhibiting a variety of male, female, and other characteristics. Androgyne identities include pangender, ambigender, non-gendered, agender, gender fluid or intergender. Androgyny can be either physical or psychological and is independent of birth sex. Occasionally, non-androgynous people adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous. This outward androgyny has been used in fashion, and the milder forms of it (women wearing men's pants or men wearing two earrings, for example) are not seen as transgender behavior.
The term androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex individual.


*Bigender*


A bigender (sometimes rendered as bi-gender, dual gender, or bi+gender) individual is one who moves between masculine and feminine gender roles. Such individuals fluidly move between two distinct personalities depending on context: whereas androgynous people retain the same gender-typed behaviour across situations, bigendered people consciously or unconsciously change their gender-role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine or vice versa.
Drag kings and queens
Drag is a term applied to clothing and make-up worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the terms drag queen covers men doing female drag, drag king covers women doing male drag, and faux queen covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community, have embraced the pornographically-derived term tranny to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing, however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people.


**Second part  : Why the hate.**


The mechanisms of Transphobia are still debated :

The transfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues in her book Whipping Girl that transphobia is rooted in sexism. She locates the origins of both transphobia and homophobia in what she calls ""oppositional sexism"", the belief that male and female are ""rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires"". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with ""traditional sexism"", the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.



The transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary. Norton writes that the ""male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends""


For my part, i think it is the same phenomen that all form of discrimination and that people just fear and hate what they resent as not being identical to what they were accustomed to. But whatever is the phenomen, the consequences are what really matter.


**The result : Discrimination**

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to transphobia or homophobia, is a common occurrence for trans people. Every 3 days a murder of a trans person is reported, and many murders are believed to go unreported. Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and ""in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims.

One of the most famous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a young trans man who was raped and murdered by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth. The events became internationally known when told in the feature film Boys Don't Cry, which earned Hilary Swank an Academy Award for best actress.

The fact is that people with unclear gender identity ressent exclusion and discrimination which can affect their well being and social condition, which is why i am writting this essay (or more precisely, pasting it from wikipedia), which you should understand by now is the actual joke related to the late planetside ban affair in which the banned had to write an essay to be unbanned, and you actually didnt have to read all this to catch.",0,2015-06-10

Jereshroom,"Prisoner's Dilemna [Solved!] ||| Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is interrogated separately, with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to: betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. Here is the offer: 

 * If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison
 * If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa)
 * If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge)

What should they choose?

Answer: Be silent...

spookmcdaid,"Seen this one in the paper... gave me a giggle ||| An elderly Irish man lay dying on his bed. While suffering the agonies of impending death, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favourite cheese scones wafting up the stairs. He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed. Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom and, with even greater effort, gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled downstairs. 

With laboured breath, he leaned against the doorframe, gazing into the kitchen. Were it not for deaths agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven, for there, spread out upon the waxed paper of the the kitchen table, were dozens of his favourite scones. 

Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted Irish wife of sixty years, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?

Mustering one great effort, he threw himself towards the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted. He could almost taste the cheese scone before it was in his mouth, seemingly bringing him back to life. The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to the nearest scone at the edge of the table, when his hand was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife...

Patrick reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 20. Go and buy yourself some underwear!'

All of the jokes were going great-- ""three ethnics walked into a bar...""; ""an American, a Canadian and an ethnic were on a plane..."" Etc etc. 

Until the latest joke started out, ""Two ethnics were walking down the street when they bumped into their rabbi...""",3,2015-06-11

""Dear Anita,
Overheating of engine after such short distance can be caused by problems associated with the carburetor. You need to check your oil and water level in your engine before you start your journey.

The younger boy says, ""Hey, man, did you see that? They got peaches any flavor you want!"".

The older boy says ""Nah, they don't. They're just trying to get your attention.""

The younger boy says ""Aw, come on! Let's go get one!""

The older boy just utters ""Fine..."" and quickly does a U-turn back towards the orchard. He parks the truck next to the sign and says ""Alright, get your peach and I'll wait here.""

The younger boy jumps out of the truck and runs towards an old house off in the distance. When he gets there, he sees an old man sitting on a rocking chair on the front porch.

The younger boy says ""Hey, that sign said 'Peaches any flavor you want'. Is it true?"".

The old man replies with ""Sure is. I got peaches any flavor you want."" 

The younger boy says ""Got any flavored like peanut butter and jelly?""

The old man points at a tree, and says ""Sure do. It's that tree just over yonder.""

The younger boy walks over to the tree and picks a peach. He takes a bite, and sure enough, it tastes just like peanut butter. But there's no hint of jelly.

""I can taste the peanut butter, but where's the jelly?"" said the younger boy.

""You just turn that peach on over, son."" says the old man

The younger boy flips the peach over and takes a bite.  The peach tastes just like grape jelly. Excited over this, he runs back to the truck.
 
""It's true! They got peaches any flavor you want!"" said the younger boy.
""Alright, I gotta see this..."" said the older brother as he gets out of the truck.

The older brother makes his way up to the old man's house.

""Alright, he says you got peaches any flavor you want. Is it true?"" said the older boy

""Sure is, sonny. I got all kinds of flavors."" said the old man

The older boy gets a smug look, and replied ""OK... You got one that tastes like pussy?""

With a sly grin, the old man points to a tree and says ""Sure do. It's that tree just over there.""

The older boy walks to the tree and picks a peach. He hesitates, but then takes a big bite. He's disgusted by the taste.

""Ugh, this tastes like shit!"" says the older boy

From the distance, he hears the old man yell ""WELL, TURN IT OVER!""

Rabbi asks, ""Is it made from pork?""

""Yes"", replies the Italian.

""Well then, I can't eat it.  It's not kosher.  God's law.""

The Italian shrugs and eats the sausage, then pulls out a bottle of wine, offering some.

Rabbi looks at the bottle and says, ""It's not kosher, I can't drink it.  God's law.""

Italian says, ""Wow your god is strict.  What if there was nothing kosher around to eat or drink?""

Rabbi replies, ""Well, he makes exceptions in situations of life and death.""

With that, the Italian points a gun at the rabbi and says, ""Drink the wine or I'll blow your head off!!""

Rabbi grabs the bottle, and with a very annoyed look on his face, downs the rest of it.

""Please don't be upset with me.  I just wanted you to have some wine"", says the Italian.

Rabbi says, ""Of course I'm upset!  Where was the gun when you had some sausage left?!?""",360,2015-06-12

The little girl runs in the house crying and tells her mother about the encounter. She runs out and buys the girl a football. The next day the boy is riding home on his bike, and the girl shows him the football, yelling ""Nah na nah na nah"". 

The little boy gets mad and points to his bike. ""See this bike? This is a boys bike, and girls can't have them!""

Next day, the boy comes by and the little girl is riding a new boys bike. Now he is really mad. So he drops his pants, points at his private parts, and says ""You see THIS? Only BOYS have these and your mother can't go buy you one!"" 

The next day as he passes the house he asks the little girl ""Well, what do you have to say NOW?""

Skarmorism,"This is a long one. What have I done.... ||| So this nun goes into a bar and there are a bunch of squids and piranhas squabbling over their most recent MMA (mixed martial arts) tournament at the Alpha Squid's house the previous weekend. The piranhas were all like ""hey it's not a fair tournament! The cephalopods always got the advantage! We got good teeth but you can squirt ink and kick us with ya tentacles and stuff!""

And the squids are like ""no, no, no, it's totally fair. Piranhas got more agility and their teeth are just plain deadly, man"". The squids are real defensive of their MMA tourney.

And this nun (who walked into the bar before, remember-bet you didn't remember) speaks up and is like ""hey, why all the fighting? Why do you need an MMA tournament in the first place?""

But then the nun's robe and veil suddenly start talking out of nowhere. Nun's Habits have been known to come alive before, but are usually held back from doing this by a restrictive Papal proclamation put forth by Pope Francis last November-the Holy Habit Constrainment Order, PO #7462.5.


But this nun's robes come alive and stuff and they start taking to these squids and piranhas.

And suddenly things are starting to make sense and the nun's Habit is laying down some awesome new ground rules for the squids' and piranhas' mutual MMA tournaments. Things are looking good.

But then the robes and veil combo, amidst the nun standing around looking bored while her clothes did all the talking, made a suggestion to split up some of the allowed MMA moves per species. It said ""you know what, why don't we limit hand moves like punching and grabbing to the squids, and we'll let the piranhas take all the footwork and agility stuff, like kicks.""

A deathly silence suddenly fell over the room. The Habit said ""what? Did I say something wrong?"" The worried look on its face was reflected by glares from the squids and piranhas alike.

The Alpha Squid stood up on his two strongest legs and walked to the door of the bar. The other squids followed him to the door. The piranhas turned their faces away in fear. At this point the Habit is so confused as to what it said to offend these squids, just being a gentle robe and headpiece and all.

But just as the squids got to the exit, they all turned around, and threw their sunglasses on Squirtle Squad style. The Alpha Squid said, calmly but firmly:

 One says, ""I'd give her a 7. She's really quite pretty."" Another agrees, and so does the third.

 The bartender, while bringing a new round of drinks to their table, overhears their rating of the young lass. He checks her out himself and says, ""Nah, I'd only give her a 2.""

 ""A 2? How can you give her a 2?"" says one of the three guys at the table. ""She's a real pretty girl."" The bartender, walking away, says, ""Well, I use the Budweiser method for rating women.""

 The guys look at each other, figure the bartender has lousy taste in women, and go back to their ratings. Moments later, another young lady, prettier than the last, walks into the bar, and they confer between themselves and decide she deserves a 9.

 However, the bartender, wiping off the table nearest to theirs, again overhears their rating of the gal. He checks her out himself and tells the fellows that he'd only give her a 5.

 ""A 5? How can you give her just a 5? She's absolutely gorgeous!""

 The bartender casually replies that he uses the Budweiser method for rating women.

 ""The Budweiser method?"" they puzzle, as the bartender returns to his post behind the bar. They are quite confused.

 Three, maybe four minutes pass by, and then a stunning blonde, 5'11"" goddess walks into the bar. Long luscious legs, sexy shape. Truly a work of flawless perfection. Without hesitation, the three ""judges"" at the table determine that this young sultress is, without any doubt, a 10.

 However, carrying a case of beer pass them to restock the supply behind the bar, the bartender once more overhears their rating of the girl. He glances studiously at her, and says that the best, the very best that he could give her, would be a 7.

 ""A 7? How in the world could you give her just a mere 7? She's gorgeous!""

 ""Well,"" says the bartender again, ""I use the Budweiser method for rating women.""

 ""Budweiser!"" says one of the guys, exasperated. ""What in the Hell is this 'Budweiser method' for rating women?""

Bushwacker61,"I agree ||| I mowed the lawn today, and after doing so I sat down and had a cold soda.

 The day was really quite beautiful, 
 and the drink facilitated some deep thinking on various topics.

 Finally I thought about the age old question:
 Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?

 Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful 
 than a guy getting kicked in the nuts.


 Well, after another soda, and some heavy deductive thinking, 
 I have come up with the answer to that question.

 Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; 
 and here is the reason for my conclusion.

 A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, 
 ""It might be nice to have another child.""

 On the other hand, you never hear a guy say,

After walking several miles, the man comes upon a farm house with the lights on. He knocks on the door, and a man clad in dirty overalls answers. The man explains his situation, and asks if it would be possible to stay the night with the farmer until he could get his car fixed in the morning. The farmer explains that the town has but one auto shop, which will not be open again until Monday. He offers to let the stranger spend the weekend, under one condition: "" You are welcome to spend the weekend here. All I ask is that you keep your hands off my two daughters, Nelly and Venus"". The stranger agrees. The next night, Nelly comes to her father and asks permission to go on a date with the stranger. ""I suppose it will be okay"", the farmer says. ""You can use my truck, but no funny business"". That night, the man and Nelly load up in the farmers old beat up truck, drive a few miles down the road to a secluded spot, where he proceeds to bang her brains out. When they finished, they returned to the farm house and went to bed as if nothing had happened. The following night, Venus approaches her father with the same request, and the farmer gives her the same answer. ""I suppose its okay. You can use my truck, but no funny business"". That night, Venus and the stranger take off to the same secluded spot where he had taken Nelly the night before, where he proceeded to bang her brains out. Monday morning comes. The man gets his car fixed and returns to his home in the city. Once he arrives home, he decides to send the farmer some money to show his appreciation, so he writes a check and mails it to him. A couple of months go by, and the man receives an unexpected letter from the farmers address. Inside the envelope he finds a poem, which read as follows: ""Are you the one that done the pushin', and left those stains upon my cushion, and your footprints on my dashboard upside down? Cause since you dated my daughter Nelly, she's had some swelling in her belly. I think you'd better come on back to town"". The man was stunned, and unsure of what to do or how to respond. After some thought on the matter, he decides to try his own hand at poetry, so he mails the farmer the following poem: ""Yes I'm the one that did the pushin', and left the stains upon your cushion, and my footprints on your dashboard upside down. But since I dated your daughter Venus, I've had some burning in my penis, so I guess we're 50/50 all around.",3,2015-06-13

The immigrant is shocked at this behavior, but wanting to remain polite, he says to the old lady: ""I am very sorry. But I meant for this pregnant woman to sit here. It is difficult for her to stand. You look healthy. I am sure it will not be a problem for you to stand.""

The old lady replies in a clear southern accent: ""Young man, I don't know which tribe you're from. But this is a civilized country and here we let the elderly sit down on the bus, not the young and healthy.""

That, to him back then, was a good thing -- after all, the Chinese wish interesting lives on others as a curse. A boring life meant that everything proceeded the way that he liked. No accidents, no oddities, no distractions. No fun, but that's the cost of safety and security.
 
As a child, John never got in a serious accident as a child (except for that time he fell off slide the wrong way, but he landed on a soft spot so that doesn't count). His adolescence was pretty temperate. He even managed not to embarrass himself scarringly in public. After that, he went to a state college, from which he graduated after four years. Then, he got a job offer from a pretty standard company where Dilbert was popular. If this went on for longer, he would have found a lovely (but not -too- lovely) lady to marry and then die surrounded by grandchildren.
 
One day, though, John felt like going to the desert.
 
The idea just struck him on a rather unspecific Friday. On the way to work, John thought to himself, ""After work, I should get an SUV so I can go off-roading."" At work, John thought about the dunes and the winds. On the way from work, John thought about how he has never seen a real desert before. That was very frustrating, so it made buying the most desert-like SUV he could find on a whim easier.
 
John woke up early the next morning. He had a light meal of cereal and strawberries for breakfast. Then he hopped on his new SUV and drove east. Just... east. The highway should take him to a desert in the east, John thought. He fiddled with the audio system a little and tried to find a radio station to listen to. But, no -- the music only distracted him from the excitement he was fermenting in right now. This was an emotion of rare intensity (considering how plaid his life has been), so logically he should savor it to the fullest.
 
With the sun at its zenith, John began to notice the dunes in the distance and the clear, blue sky above them. All inhibition was gone -- he pressed on the gas pedal and the SUV ran at very slightly above the speed limit. He just... had to get there, and feel his car wade through the sand and rocks. There must be so many sights in the wastes to see. He might even run across a saguaro. Ah, damn, he should have brought a camera and someone to take a picture of him next to the tallest saguaro he could find. And before John even realized it himself, he was off the road for the first time.
 
He had a blast. The desert was so different from the city or the beach. Everything felt pure and rarefied there, as if all the dross had been burnt away by the sun's heat. Speaking of which, the sun was blazing hot. Even with the AC at full power, John could feel the desert heat, and the tan that the sun through the window was giving. Anyways, it was probably the first time John went ""crazy"". The sensation of losing control just by a little bit overwhelmed him. The rough terrain rocked him uncomfortably, but he far preferred it to the certain comfort of the office chair. Every once in a he worried if the SUV was going to flip -- but then, it didn't. It gave him a jolt like nothing else. He has never done any hard drugs before, but it must be nothing like off-roading in the desert. Exploring virgin, untrodden sand felt like a series of small conquests. Venturing where no man has gone before, freely going wherever he wan----
 
And then, a blink and a beep.
 
Out of gas.
 
...
 
With a plastic bottle in each hand, John waded through the sand trying to swallow him whole. It was so hard to maintain balance, with the ground shifting and sinking with each footstep. The scorching evening sun didn't help, either. The desert sun at noon must have been more painful, but at least it didn't get in your eye. John had been following the sun for a few hours now. At first, he tried to backtrack, but the tracks had already been erased by the desert wind. ""The desert is to the east,"" John thought, ""so I should go west.""
 
John had already drunk half the bottle of water by the time the sun set. This was pretty bad, because when he got out of the car he expected for the bottle to last at least until tomorrow late afternoon. ""It will be even hotter at noon tomorrow,"" John thought to himself again. ""I'm fucked.""
 
The night cold of the desert gave such a hateful contrast to the day heat. He had heard that it's cold at night in deserts, but John didn't think it would be -this- cold. He was freezing, for God's sake. And it's so arid. John hugged himself even tighter to keep himself warm, next to the tallest saguaro he has ever seen. He thought about getting into the sand to protect himself from the cold, but then sand would get in all of his clothes and he would be annoyed to death tomorrow. He also thought about crying, but he fell unconscious before he could make the decision.
 
The next morning, John once again considered crying, because he must have lost the good bottle over the night. Either the wind took it or it sank into the sand somewhere. Maybe the devil took it, he doesn't know. John looked at the only bottle he has left now -- the bottle with pale blue liquid in it. He has heard that they use water and denatured ethanol in windshield washer fluids and, while it would burn, it would at least quench the thirst. It will probably taste like the worst thing ever, but that's preferable to being mummified alive.
 
The sun was at its zenith when John worked up the courage to try drinking the windshield washer. He kept seeing an oasis in a distance, but it kept running away -- so he concluded that he has begun hallucinating from the heat and the thirst. Might as well try this out anyway, and... Jesus Christ, it tasted like murder. The fluid stabbed at John's dry throat and burned it, like vodka distilled from hate. The pain faded away after a few seconds. Thankfully, his throat wasn't as dry anymore. John resumed to soldier forth.
 
...
 
Why did he listen to the horse? He should have walked -away- from the morning sun, because the sun rises from the east. Thanks to the stupid animal, John was walking the wrong way for half a day. But most importantly -- where did this horse come from?
 
...
 
The sun was setting. John had trouble understanding his own gibberish anymore. It also might have been getting dark faster than is usual for summer, because everything was so hard to see. He drank the last gulp of the windwasher fluid and tossed the bottle away (John would usually not litter). Then he collapsed onto his knees, sinking a little bit into the dune. It's so hard to walk anymore, but crawling was really easy. John fondly regarded his childhood. As the sand cooked his hands and legs, John's life began to play out in his hazy mind like a VHS tape that's been too close to a magnet. ""Life was pretty boring, wasn't it?,"" John's brain stringed together some words. ""Getting into a fight once might have been fun."" All the things he couldn't do, all the regret came in like a tsunami and swept away all hopes for escape. He decided to cry, but he couldn't. He tried wailing, but only dry gasp came out of his throat.
 
John became afraid of death, but then he felt the cold marble floor beneath him.
 
""You look like death,"" a voice said. John looked up, but he could only see black and red spots against a field of dark brown felt. ""You should find help before the cold kills you.""
 
Even in his delirium, John could tell that this must not be real. For one, the voice was too beautiful. Had angels been real, the voice must have belonged to one. But no matter, he just didn't want to die.
 
""I don't want to die.""
 
""Is that a wish?"" the voice replied, now with a tone of definite curiosity. ""I mean, I can help you with that if you so wish. But you have to pay a price. With this contract you mus--""
 
""Just help me.""
 
""Okay, we have a deal,"" said the voice. And then John felt a pair of fangs spear into his throat.
 
...
 
There were so many stars in the night sky. One usually thinks that night is dark, but with so many stars, the night sky was actually bright. Lying with his back against the marble floor (surprisingly comfortable, actually), John tried to trace as many constellations as he could from memory for a few minutes.
 
""Are you feeling better now?,"" a sort-of familiar voice was heard from outside the vision, with concern. ""I broke a few rules, but, you know, I just didn't want to deal with someone dying right in front of me.""
 
John bolted up to see what the fuck just happened right there. He surprised himself -- it was so easy. Not compared to how he was near death, but to how he usually is. Not only that, he felt wonderful.
 
He turned around to see a snake with red eyes. A very large snake with burning red eyes.
 
It took a few seconds for John to assess the situation. And then he said -- ""Thank you... for saving my life.""
 
The snake slithered across the air to get close to John, its tongue feeling the air to smell how he was now. ""No need to thank me, it's all a part of work. Anyways, are you feeling better now?"" 
 
""Yeah. Better than ever, actually."" John tried to figure out exactly what made him feel better. Whatever happened, he now felt more... vigorous, energetic and... unburdened? As if a life-long chain has been lifted. ""What did you do?""
 
""Oh, you know. Granted a wish and all that."" John could have sworn that the snake grinned widely. ""When you came here, you were dying from methanol poisoning. So I detox'd you. You were also very thirsty, so I took care of that. But most importantly, there was a small cancer growing in your liver.""
 
The snake uncoiled itself from a... stick, that emerged from at the center of a very ornately engraved circular white marble floor. As it slithered around the perimeter, the spilt sand was swept away. Apparently it was cleaning the floor. It also showed that the snake must have been at least fifteen yards in length. ""Though, to clarify: you asked for not to die, but that wish is against the rules. So... I gave it a liberal interpretation. So you will not die -for a while-. I made you very healthy, so you probably won't have trouble living to be 120 years old."" The snake nodded its head. ""As long as you don't get yourself killed, you know. It seems like you do stuff like this often.""
 
John shook his head in denial. ""No, this is my first time. And... rules?,"" he questioned. ""Are you some kind of a genie? Or are you the Devil?""
 
The snake made some kind of sound that probably equated to snakes laughing. ""Oh, it never gets old. No, I'm not a genie and I'm not the Devil. I'm just a fallen angel."" It coiled itself against the stick and looked right into John's eyes. The fiery eyes flared like twin suns and rays of starlight descended from the sky to shine in the shape of ephemeral wings on the back. The voice, it suffocated the sound of desert silence and quaked the very space itself. ""I am Nathaniel, the seraph.""
 
""I am John,"" the mortal introduced himself. ""...the office drone.""
 
The fires died out, the lights turned to normal and the rolling sound of silence returned. ""So, yeah. No need to be scared or anything,"" Nathaniel seemed to grin as he spoke. ""I'm just... here doing my job. Speaking of which.""
 
The angel cleared his throat before elaborating on the ""rules"": ""Ok, God sent me here to hire someone for a task. It's a very important and difficult job, so the compensation for it is pretty good. Those who accept the job are given three wishes. These wishes can be anything, as long as you really, actually and truly want it and as long as it doesn't trespass God's authority. And, no, I'm not one of those asshole spirits that twist the wishes or give them literally. God's the one doing the work, so I don't need to be stringent or anything. Your first wish has been fulfilled. You have two wishes left. Be very careful and deliberate for those two, because they have to compensate for the duty you've been given.""
 
""What's my duty?"" John asked, dumbstruck and unable to believe.
 
Nathaniel looked away a little, as if he felt uncomfortable breaking the news. ""Well, ok. John. I'll put this very simply this time. Your duty is to end the world.""
 
Awkward silence followed. Nathaniel seemed to brace for an inevitable tirade. John, to the contrary, was at complete loss for words. The mortal occasionally opened his mouth to say something, perhaps in protest or in confusion, but then he closed it again. He would try again when he felt he had processed the situation sufficiently, but no -- he was wrong. At least for a few minutes.
 
And, eventually. ""So... My job is to end the world.""
 
""Yes.""
 
""Why? And how? And when?""
 
""Well, ok. It's kinda convoluted. And you are handling this very maturely right now, by the way."" Nathaniel coughed softly before continuing. ""As for why... Hm. Imagine that you are making a perpetual motion machine. Once you get it going, it keeps going. Maybe it goes faster and faster if you are good enough at making machines, I don't know. Anyways, when it goes too fast, it's dangerous to stop it from outside. It would hurt if your finger got jammed between the gears, right? So... God made a self-termination switch."" Nathaniel unwound himself from the stick. ""This right here is the switch. God put it here so someone can stop the world from the inside if it becomes necessary.
 
""And now, as for how... It's simple. You -- and only you -- can move this staff. If you push it, pull it, or in any other way disturb it, everything dies. Nothing gets left behind. Nada. Nil. Zilch. Once you do it, it's done."" Nathaniel gestured his tail across his throat. ""It's really easy, but it's total and it's irreversible. That's why it's so hard.""
 
John listened attentively, though he took it only three-quarters-seriously. After all, a talking snake?
 
""Hm. Ok, last question. When... is up to you."" Had Nathaniel been human, a look of doubt and fear would have come across his face. Sadly, he was still a snake. ""It's your job to determine when the world will end. Now that you have been chosen, I can't stop you from deciding when. Even if you try to pull the plug on the world because you got dumped by your girl... well, they say 'significant other' now, don't they? Well, by your significant other, I'm not allowed to stop you in any way or spirit. But I can ask you to be very deliberate. Please, please be very deliberate."" The snake gazed at the human intently. ""There is so much to this world that I haven't seen yet and I would like to learn more about it before it ends.""
 
Nathaniel stopped to speak for a short while. Assuming that he has finished explaining, John brought his right hand to his chin to help him consider the situation. It all was very confusing. Before this day, John didn't believe in God. And, if anything, he wasn't believing in God more at this point. Why would God do this sort of thing? It's all very absurd.
 
But, from the deep of his soul, John could feel that he was given a very, very serious duty.
 
""Why was I chosen?""
 
""You... uh... found me."" Nathaniel shifted his focus away from John, as if he was taken by a sense of inadequacy. ""Long before I had criteria for selecting people for this job, but they were all lousy at it. After a while, I decided to not have any at all."" The snake sighed. ""I think it's been working out greatly. Somehow random people are more emotionally stable than prophesied legendary heroes.""
 
""What if I don't want to do it?""
 
""It's too late.""
 
""Can I wish not to have to do this?""
 
Nathaniel sighed. ""No, that's infringing on God's authority, so it's against the rules. You -have- to do it, John. And I'm pretty sure you will be good at it.""
 
""How do you know that?"" John accused the angel of empty words of comfort.
 
""I have been talking to you for a good while now, haven't I?"" The snake's facial muscles did their best to smile. ""After a few billion years, you learn how to read people.""
 
It seemed that John wanted to argue with that, but only silence followed for a moment.
 
""This is a stupid job.""
 
""It pays well.""
 
...
 
On the circle, the night air felt cool rather than cold. Waiting for dawn's light, John watched the stars trace the globe of the sky once he ran out of things to ask Nathaniel about. Well, he was curious if he was actually an angel and, if he was, what it is like to be an angel.
 
But that all felt improper.
 
John found the morning star when the skirt of the sky began to grow yellow, pink and red. In minutes, it would be bright again. He would have to find a way to get back home from here. Perhaps continuing going west is the best course of action--
 
""If you walk south from here for about three hours, you will find a highway. Go eastbound and there will be a small town. If you tell them that you got lost while off-roading, they will help you out,"" Nathaniel interrupted John's train of thought. ""And you must be hungry, right? Here, have something to eat before you head out.""
 
A plate consisting of a loaf of bread, a chunk of cheese and a mug of wine sat on the marble floor.
 
""Thanks, but where did you get this?""
 
""Heaven.""
 
...
 
John dusted his pants one more time. As he stepped outside the border of the marble circle, he could feel the sun grow a thousand times more fierce.
 
""Uh, hey, Nate,"" John said hesitantly. ""Do you mind if I come back later for the other two wishes? I can't think of anything good right now.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel. And it's ok, that's what most people do when they don't feel like asking for money.""
 
""People seriously ask for money?"" John asked in surprise at the banality.
 
""Well, I know what you mean. I think it's odd when people ask for money over... true love, or peace, or anything like that. I asked a few why.""
 
""What did they say?""
 
""'You are too young to understand'. Which is kind of funny, because, you know, billions of years old,"" the snake seemed to smirk. ""But they probably meant that I'm not close enough to death to understand.""
 
John seemed clearly unsatisfied at the answer or the extrapolation. ""I still don't get it. It'd be nice to understand what they meant. Perhaps I'll ask for that when I come back later. To understand what other people are saying.""
 
Nathaniel's tongue licked the air a few times. ""That would be interesting. I don't think anyone has asked for that before. Do you want that wish granted now?""
 
John hesitated for a moment.
 
""Nah. I need a reason to come back here for.""
 
With that, John smiled brightly at Nathaniel, and walked south.
 
...
 
After that weekend, John's life seemed to return to normal. The snake stopped appearing in his dreams after a week or so and he eventually forgot that he doesn't need health check-ups anymore in three months' time. It was boring again. Very stable, but boring.
 
A year since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.
 
""Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,"" the barrel of the gun said.
 
John reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown wallet. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, wondering: ""Why do you want this?""
 
The barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.
 
After that encounter, John remembered that wish he wanted granted.
 
...
 
This time, John drew a map. He learned from the Internet how to prepare for desert exploration. Over a period of a month, he gathered the tools and gears needed to save him the pain. Learning how to locate himself using the stars would have been useful, but that's too much work; he'll just bet on his luck on that. With a rental SUV, he drove his way to the small village to the southeast and, from there, carefully trekked up north with a pair of binoculars. He started his search in the morning and found Nathaniel by mid-afternoon.
 
""What's up?"" the angel asked.
 
""I got mugged,"" John answered.
 
""Ah, damn. Did you get hurt?"" A tone of worry and concern colored Nathaniel's voice.
 
""No, but it helped me remember something."" John spoke very evenly. Perhaps he wanted to come off unconcerned?
 
""Nearly dying once?""
 
""Huh."" John amusedly reviewed the situation, now and back then. ""Maybe. I should hire a psychoanalyst.""
 
""Freudians are a bunch of quacks. And they are very expensive,"" dismissed Nathaniel.
 
John replied with a smile. ""It's fun, though.""
 
The conversation broke for about ten seconds; a period during which desert gust blew across the landscape.
 
""Hey, Nate.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel. And time to pull the plug?"" The angel put on a very as-a-matter-of-factly attitude.
 
""Um."" John put his right hand on his chin to help him consider the proposition, but: ""No, not today.""
 
Nathaniel breathed a sigh of relief.
 
""I actually came back for my second wish.""
 
""I would have preferred if you came for friendship.""
 
It broke for another time; during this period, a desert creature cried out in the far back.
 
""You think of me as a friend?"" John asked with honest awe.
 
""Anybody's your friend when your neighbors are rocks and cacti."" The snake clicked his tongue. ""I don't have that many people to talk to, being bound here and all.""
 
""Really? You can't leave?""
 
""Well."" Nathaniel hesitated. ""I can leave... I think. Well, probably not. Anyways, if I do I might not see you come here and pull the lever. Then I won't be able to plug my ears.""
 
""I thought everyone just... died. Nothing loud.""
 
""Well, everyone just dies, yeah. In very big explosions.""
 
""You can't plug your ears. You don't have arms.""
 
""I can try.""
 
The sound of sands rolling down the dunes punctuated the conversation.
 
""I want you to grant me my second wish."" John demanded.
 
Excited to find out what John has in mind, Nathaniel eagerly questioned. ""Oh? What will it be this time?""
 
""I want to be able to understand people.""
 
The snake paused for a second, perhaps to discern whether it would be a good wish for John or not. In the end, he said: ""That is a very difficult wish to live with, you know that?""
 
""I figured so.""
 
""Well, no regrets.""
 
Nathaniel bit John.
 
...
 
When John woke up, the sun was setting. Stars could be faintly seen through the still-pale blue sky, and a pregnant moon was floating about as well. A shooting star burnt through the atmosphere, leaving a short trail, far away from John's focus when a curious voice was heard.
 
""Are you feeling better now?""
 
""Um. Yeah."" John reoriented himself. ""Thanks, Nate.""
 
""Call me Nathaniel.""
 
""Now that I think about it, do I annoy you when I call you Nate?"" John asked the angel, with sincerity.
 
""Well,"" Nathaniel considered the question. ""A little?""
 
""But that's how a friend would call you. Nathaniel is a mouthful.""
 
""Agreed on that. But, you know."" The angel paused for a second.
 
""What is it?""
 
Nathaniel slowly uncoiled himself from the switch and slithered toward the perimeter, dutifully. ""God gave me this name.""
 
The sound of Nathaniel's scales against the marble floor and the sand grains on it filled the air.
 
""I think I can understand that."" John admitted. ""I still don't believe in God, but I think I can understand that.""
 
The snake giggled. ""Is that because you learned how to understand me?""
 
""No. Actually, no, I don't think so."" John gripped his chin. ""At least, this isn't what I asked for.""
 
Nathaniel laughed.
 
...
 
John didn't bother sitting up that night. He just laid comfortably on his back and watched the stars, while chatting with Nathaniel about, in sum, everything about the world.
 
""Hey, you said you can't leave the circle, right? But you seem pretty up to date,"" John asked.
 
""Doves,"" answered Nathaniel. ""They drop by every once in a while.""
 
John finally asked the angel about whether he was really an angel or not. The answer was very elaborate -- Nathaniel was apparently very proud of the time before he fell. He explained what it is like to be in Heaven and in presence of God. It all sounded like some fantasy novel to John, but even then, it was the most interesting fantasy novel. Perhaps because it was being told in person, and by a very excited character?
 
""Hey, Nathaniel, I hope you don't mind me asking, but..."" John considered the true worth of bringing this up. ""Why did you fall""?
 
""Um. How do I put this?"" Nathaniel pondered for a second or so. ""I wanted to explore the world that God made more closely.""
 
""That's it?""
 
""I accidentally ended the dinosaurs.""
 
""Oh.""
 
Nathaniel asked if John liked to travel. John didn't, so he said no. When it was apparent that Nathaniel was disappointed (perhaps he wanted to hear travel stories), John explained that he wasn't a very adventurous person. He has never done anything out of ordinary in his life and he has grown too comfortable with it. Travelling explicitly means leaving one's comfort zone. John could never do that.
 
""But you came here,"" wondered Nathaniel.
 
""You are right.""
 
""Maybe this could be a first step.""
 
""I'll think about it.""
 
And then it was morning.
 
...
 
John promised to return soon when he left Nathaniel this time. He meant it -- after all, this might be a good way to break out of his routine. Furthermore, Nathaniel so badly wants to travel and explore but can't. To linger in the comfort zone forever would be an insult to a good friend.
 
And so John quit his office job and began to travel around the world, for a few years.
 
First, he went to India. Then Tibet, followed by Maghreb. He went to Europe, but did not go to Britain. Hungary was very enjoyable, even though he ran out of money there. John washed dishes and kicked people out of clubs for a few months -- he met many interesting people doing so. Once he's gathered enough money, he hopped on a boat back to America. Over the Atlantic, John finished his plans on walking across and around North America.
 
...
 
""I brought you books.""
 
""I thought you died.""
 
""Can you read?""
 
""You lied when you'd return soon.""
 
""Well.""
 
...
 
Back in his apartment, John tried to figure out his next course of action. He learned a lot in the last five years from all that travel and all that talk, he thought. Perhaps writing about the lessons might be a good idea.
 
...
 
""I brought you books.""
 
""Ooh! Did you bring yours, too?""
 
""What? Why would you need self-help books?""
 
""I have a lot of time to improve myself.""
 
""You've been like that for a few billion years.""
 
""Well.""
 
...
 
Sixty years since meeting Nathaniel, John got mugged.
 
""Give me all you got, bitch, or I'll blow up your head,"" the barrel of the gun said.
 
John reached for his back pocket and produced an old, light brown notepad. Calmly, he handed it to the mugger, saying: ""All I have is names and directions.""
 
The barrel dropped. The dumbfounded face behind it asked if John was fucking serious.
 
John remembered the last wish.
 
...
 
When John climbed the last dune to the marble circle, he noticed that Nathaniel brought someone for their monthly meeting. It was quite out of the ordinary, but no matter -- if a good friend wants to introduce him to them, then it must be good.
 
""What's up?"" The angel asked.
 
""I got mugged,"" John answered.
 
""Again?""
 
John shrugged, as if at a loss for a proper response. ""Well, this is the second time. At least that I remember.""
 
""Hm,"" Nathaniel reconsidered. ""It feels like yesterday for me.""
 
""So..."" John eyed the new guest.
 
""Ah, yes."" The big snake encircled the little snake and tightened in, probably affectionately. ""This is my daughter, John. I want you to meet her.""
 
The words brought a smile to John's face. He leaned down to be closer to the child. ""Hi. What's your name?""
 
""Call me Sarai.""
 
""My name is John."" Saying his, he offered his hand. ""It's very nice to meet you.""
 
The girl extended her tail and gripped onto the index finger. Will do for a handshake.
 
""Now that I've met such an adorable young girl,"" John mused, ""I can't pull the lever in front of her anymore.""
 
""Speaking of which...""
 
The unusual heaviness of Nathaniel's voice made John uncomfortable, and maybe a little queasy.
 
""Before that happens, old friend. Could you grant me a wish this time?""
 
...
 
First, they were going to ride across Canada and America. After that they will head down south, driving around South America by the Pacific and the Atlantic. It would be very nice if they could head to the Amazon, too, but it was doubtful that it had accommodations for an RV.
 
Sarai sat on John's right shoulder as they traveled. She would be so excited to see anything that isn't made of sand and rocks. It reminded John of himself back long ago, when he first came to the desert. It was so different. It might have been meaningless to someone who has always been there, but to outsiders, it's exotic and special. Perhaps this is why Nathaniel is so curious about the world -- he is an outsider to all but the tiny little circle in the desert. Everything is exotic and special to him.
 
The best he could do for him was to show the world to his child. When they have seen every thing there is to see in this world, Sarai will go home and tell her father all about it. Nathaniel might not be able to leave until the day he dies, but at least he would have explored the world vicariously. Little satisfactions.
 
...
 
""Hey, John, what should we tell him first about?"" Sarai asked John, on their way to the desert.
 
""I don't know, Sarai. What was the most fun for you?""
 
""Mmm."" The girl pondered. ""I liked the mountains. They were like the dunes, except really big and really tall.""
 
""Which mountains? We saw many of them, didn't we?""
 
""Ehhh. I can't remember them all.""
 
It's been six months since Nathaniel asked John to show Sarai the world. Before leaving for Africa, she wanted to see her father again. John agreed -- it might be years they might be spending there, this time. Furthermore, he couldn't wait for his third wish.
 
The road and the desert seemed different this time. Almost... like the first time. Sense of excitement and wonder. Was it because they couldn't wait to share their experience with Nathaniel? In any case, they had to see him as quickly as possible.
 
The RV crawled up the dunes rather slowly. It seemed to do so well everywhere else... But this was the last time they will be riding this thing. On the other hand, it was somewhat nostalgic for John. The imbalance on the sand. The uncomfortable rocking. The loss of control.
 
The loss of control.
 
""DADDY!!!"" The moment she spotted him down the dune, Sarai screamed from John's shoulder. He must have pressed either the brake or the gas pedal too hard. The wheels spun out of control in the sand. The weight of the RV slowly dragged it down the slope, gradually but surely accelerating as it goes. John tried to regain control, but it seemed too late.
 
And it was heading right onto the circle.
 
Nathaniel had already uncoiled himself from the lever, to see what's going on with the RV sliding down the dune. And then he realized -- it is John who is driving that thing... and it is in crash course with the switch that will end the world.
 
John noticed the very large snake bunch up between the falling vehicle and the switch. At the rate it's going, the RV will hit Nathaniel and flip. That surely would kill Nathaniel, but the alternative is the lever behind him. But can John live with himself after killing his oldest friend like this? If he can't live with that, then maybe it's better to swerve, so the lever instead of Nathaniel will be hit. Either way, John's world will have come to end.
 
And to think that John's last wish was for Nathaniel to be free from his duty so he can explore the world with them.
 
A mere second before impact.
 
John had to choose.

	A woman walks into a pet store looking for a new pet. After a few minutes of browsing around, she's not impressed by what she finds. She's about to walk out, until she looks behind the sales counter and spots the most unusual bird she's ever seen. She asks the salesman what it is.  
	""Oh, that's a crunch bird!"" he says.   
	""Crunch bird? Never heard of it. What does it do?"" she asks.   
	""Just watch!"" he says as he opens the cage. ""Crunch bird, chair!"" He points to a wooden chair in the corner of the store. The bird flies out of the cage and heads straight for it. Within a matter of seconds, it's reduced to a pile of sawdust.   
	The woman is impressed, but asks for another demonstration.   
	""Crunch bird, desk!"" the salesman says, pointing at a nearby desk. Once again, the bird aims straight for it, and turns it to dust in a matter of seconds.  
	""I'll take him!"" the woman says.   
	He tells her it's not for sale, but she begs and tells him money is no object. Finally put in a corner, he accepts her offer, and she takes the bird home.  
	Her husband arrives home from work a while later and immediately spots the cage.  
	""What the hell kinda bird is that?"" he asks.   
	""It's a crunch bird!"" she says. He's not impressed.

He became very depressed because he had loved to play golf.

He took a lift to the top of a very tall building, intending to jump off. He was standing on the ledge looking down when on the pavement far below he saw a man skipping along, whistling and kicking up his heels. 

Fred looked more closely and saw that the man had no arms at all. He started thinking: what am I doing up here feeling sorry for myself? I still have one good arm to do things with. There goes a man with no arms, skipping down the pavement, perfectly happy, getting on with his life. 

He hurried down and caught up with the man with no arms. He told him how glad he was to see him because he had lost one of his arms and felt ugly and useless and had been going to kill himself. 

""You saved my life. If you can go on with no arms, I can make it with one!"" 

The man with no arms began dancing and whistling and kicking up his heels again.

When Bill and Hillary first got married Bill said, ""I put a box under the bed. Promise me you will never to look in it."" In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. On the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In it were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. 

  
She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there was such a box and with those contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner. After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, “I'm so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?” 
  

Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.” Hillary was shocked, but thought, ""Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. And since I know he is addicted to sex, three times is not too bad.” 

 
She said, ”OK Bill, I guess I can forgive you.” Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""So why do you have all that money in the box?” 
  

He answered, ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center.""

zzgoogleplexzz,"The Husband Store ||| A store that sells new husbands has just opened in New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:

You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids . 

'That's nice', she thinks, 'but I want more.'

So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.

'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!'

Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.

The first floor has wives that love sex.

The second floor has wives that love sex, have big tits and lots of money.

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.",221,2015-06-14

'Good God, woman! Why aren't you wearing any skivvies?', Ole demanded. 

'Well, you don't give me enough housekeeping money to afford any.' 

The Swede immediately reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 50. Go and buy yourself some underwear. 

Next, the Irishman's wife bends over to set her ball on the tee. Her skirt also blows up to show that she, too, is wearing no undies. 

'Blessed Virgin Mary, woman! You've no knickers. Why not?' 

She replies, 'I can't afford any on the money you give me.' 

Patrick reaches into his pocket and says, 'For the sake of decency, here's a 20. Go and buy yourself some underwear!' 


Lastly, the Scotsman's wife bends over. The wind also takes her skirt over her head to reveal that she, too, is naked under it. 

'Sweet mudder of Jaysus, Aggie! Where ta friggin hell are yer drawers?'

So the three of them went to a nearby lake and cast out a small row boat in the middle of the lake. Now it was getting to be around midday, and the sun was beating down on the three men. The priest suddenly stood up and exclaimed ""My, it is becoming a very hot day and we forgot to pack some drinks. I am going to go the store and get some soda for myself."" So the priest jumped off the boat, walked on the water to the shore, went to the store and bought a soda. He then came back to the boat the same way and once again started to fish. The preacher after some time told the other two that he was feeling thirsty as well and will be going to the store. So the preacher stood up, jumped off the boat, walked on the water to the shore, went to the store and bought some water. Like the priest, he came back to the boat and began to fish. The rabbi saw what the other two did and sat there in disbelief. He couldn't believe that they both were able to walk on water. So he said to them, ""Hmph it is so easy to walk on water anyone can do it. I am also going to go to the store to get something to drink."" So the rabbi jumped out of the boat and then began to flail around in the water. The priest and the preacher looked at each other.

An American, a Canadian and a Scotsman get into a car accident... and they all fuckin die. Just like that. BOOM. Dead. No survivors.
Seeing as they all died at the exact same moment, they all arrive at the Pearly Gates together.
They all walk up to St. Peter to see what deal is on getting into heaven... St. Peter sayeth unto them, ""I can tell by the looks of yas that you're all sinners... but we seem to be having some sort of malfunction with our registry, so for 50 units of each of your currency respectively, we'll just let you in.""
The American, knowing a good deal when he hears it, opens his wallet and hands a crisp $50 bill to St. Peter without hesitation. St. Peter thanks the man and pulls the lever to let him through the gates.
The American can't believe his luck. He's struttin through Heaven with a big shit-eating grin on his face, waiving at all the angels and familiar faces... and after several minutes, he realizes his friends who died with him are nowhere to be found. Concerned, he inquires to an angel about his friend's whereabouts.
""The last I heard,"" sayeth the angel unto him, ""the Canadian was trying to get his government to pay his fee, and the Scotsman was still hagglin the price.""

Someone behind them then says, ""I can't even turn my head anymore"" and everyone in the room nods in agreement.

The optimist among them then says, ""Hey its not so bad, at least we all still have our drivers license.""

Extra backstory: I went to Church with my grandparents today, and my grandpa wanted to drive. He is 77 years old and an awful driver. It takes both my grandparents to drive. My grandpa steers and my grandma sits in the back to tell him when he can switch lanes, back up, anything like that (because he can't turn his head). He also doesn't observe speed limit signs. He doesn't drive fast, its just whatever the speed limit is he cruises around 25mph. The road to my church has a speed limit of 40. His response while driving?

“It starts at $500 for a hand-job,” replies the hooker.

“$500 dollars? For a hand-job?” says the guy “No hand-job is worth that kind of money!”

So the hooker says, “Do you see that Denny’s on the corner?”

“Yes.”

“Do you see the Denny’s about a block further down?”

“Yes.”

“And beyond that, do you see that third Denny’s?”

“Yes.”

“Well,” says the hooker, smiling invitingly, “I own those. And, I own them because I give a hand-job that’s worth $500.”

The guy thinks to himself, “What the hell? You only live once. I’ll give it a try.” and accepts the hooker’s offer. They retire to a nearby motel. A short time later, the guy is sitting on the bed realising that he just experienced the hand-job of a lifetime, worth every bit of $500. He is so amazed, he says, “I suppose a blow-job is $1,000?”

“$1,500″ says the hooker

“I wouldn’t pay that for a blow-job!” he says

The hooker replies, “Step over here to the window, big boy. Do you see that casino just across the street? I own that casino outright. And I own it because I give a blow-job that’s worth every cent of $1,500.”

The guy, basking in the afterglow of that terrific hand-job, decides to put off the new car for another year or so, and says, “OK Sign me up.”

Ten minutes later, he is sitting on the bed more amazed than before. He can scarcely believe it, but he feels he truly got his money’s worth. He decides to dip into the retirement savings for one glorious and unforgettable experience. He asks the hooker, “How much for some pussy?”

The hooker says, “Come over here to the window, I want to show you something. Do you see how the whole city of Las Vegas is laid out before us, all those beautiful lights, gambling palaces, and showplaces?”

“Damn!” the guy says, in awe, “You own the whole city?”

“Nope,” says the hooker, “but I would if I had a pussy.”

Customer: What's the difference in the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.

Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.

Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint?

Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.

Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.

Customer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?

Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of thatweek and continue painting until at least Sunday.

Customer: You've got to be *...%^#@* kidding!

Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.

Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!

Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sellonly a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by theway, the price per gallon just went to $16. We don't have any more $12paint.

Customer: The price went up as we were talking?

Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds oftimes a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with yourpaint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint assoon as possible. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll haveenough.

Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don'tuse it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint youalready have.

Customer: WHAT?

Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom,hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do thebedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint.

Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? IAlready paid you for it!

Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea thatall our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts ofproblems.

Customer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible happensif I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!

Clerk: Oh yes! Every gallonyou bought automatically becomes the $200 paint.

Customer: But what are all these ""Paint on sale from $10 alitre"" signs?

Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The second half-gallon tocomplete the room is $20. None of the cans have labels,some are empty and there are norefunds, even on the empty cans.

Customer: I can't believe this! I'll buy what I need somewhereelse!

Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint forYour bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room fromsomeone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairwayfrom anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in onlyone direction, it will be $300 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!

Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at whichYou started. A hallway is different.

Customer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only paintin one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint.

Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the differenceon your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.

Customer: You're insane!

Clerk: Thanks for painting with United.",195,2015-06-15

The moving walkway motor jammed, so he un-jams it. People can get from place to place more easily. The TV was grainy and unclear, so he fixes the connection to the Satellite dish and now they get hundreds of high def channels.

One day, God decides to look down on Hell to see how his grand design is working out and notices that everyone is happy and enjoying umbrella drinks. He asks the Devil what's up?

The Devil says, ""Things are great down here since you sent us an engineer.""

""What?"" says God. ""An engineer? I didn't send you one of those. That must have been a mistake. Send him upstairs immediately.""

The Devil responds, ""No way. We want to keep our engineer. We like him.""

God demands, ""If you don't send him to me immediately, I'll sue!""

A few years pass, and the other two are doing just fine. Then, the second man, waking up, rolls over and stands up - ""QUACK!"" Straight onto a duck. Another woman, even more horrible and smelly than the last is chained to him. ""This is your wife, now and for all eternity.""

More years pass, and eventually, the saint appears, along with a chain on his arm. On the other end is a woman more beautiful than any he had ever seen. He asks the saint, ""Why? I never stepped on a duck.""

The woman pipes up, ""I did.""

surelyucantbserious,"Once there was a man named Zade Zazinski... ||| Once there was a man named Zade Zazinski.  Zade was always last for everything due to his name.  Everything always seemed to run out before Zade received his portion.  Schoolbooks, supplies, food rations.  Disappointed, Zade joined the military out of high school thinking that he would be treated equally by the armed forces.  


Once he arrived at basic training things did not go as planned. He went to the rifle range on his first day.  His drill sergeant told him, “Sorry Zazinski, we’ve run out of rifles. You’ll just have to pretend out there.” Since Zade had so much practice at making due with what he had, he went with it.  Zade stepped up to the firing line, held an imaginary rifle up and said, “Bang. Bang. Bang.”   The next day he received a certificate for good marksmanship.


The following day’s training consisted of learning how to use a bayonet.  Again, the drill sergeant said, “Sorry Zazinski. We’ve run out of bayonets, you’ll just have to pretend.”  So again, Zade stepped up to the hanging dummy and screamed “Stab. Stab. Stab.” The next day he received commendations for good bayonetsmanship.


On the third day the group headed to the grenade range.  Again the drill sergeant said, “Zazinski, we have no more grenades. You’ll just have to pretend out there.”  So Zade threw imaginary grenades while making explosion sounds, “Brooosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” The next day he received high honors for good grenade throwing.


Soon after, Zade was deployed to war.  With the honors he received at basic, Zazinski hoped he would be the dependable soldier they needed on the warfront.  Deep down he knew it would happen, but Zazinski was still disappointed to learn that there was not enough equipment to go around.  Again he was told to just pretend.  


Zade is sent to the front lines.  He sees the enemy soldiers in the distance.  Grabbing his rifle, Zade took aim and said, “Bang. Bang. Bang.” Three enemy soldiers fell over dead.  


As they advanced further, Zade pulled the fake pins from his faux grenades and lobbed them at the enemy saying, “Broosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” Giant explosions tore through the enemy, killing at least 20 combatants.  


Soon the enemy was close enough to require close combat.  Once again, Zade reacted by attaching his bayonet and screaming, “Stab. Stab. Stab.”  Anyone who got close fell with knife wounds in their bodies.


Zade continued to use his fake weaponry to decimate the battlefield.  Shouts of “Bang, Stab, Broosh,” echoed across the wasteland that was the warzone.  Enemy soldiers fell left and right.  It seemed that no one was safe from the onslaught of Zazinski.  Casualties piled up until finally, there were only two people left; Zazinski, and an enemy soldier who marched directly at him.


“Bang. Bang. Bang.” said Zade, but nothing happened.



“Broosh. Kerpow. Shblaam.” Again, nothing.



Soon the enemy was within bayonet range.



“Stab. Stab. Stab.” 



Nothing.



With a look of disbelief Zazinski fell underneath the relentless forward march of the enemy soldier.



Zade had just enough time to look the soldier over, noticing the name tag reading ‘Zembrowski,’ and to hear the final words of his life spoken by the enemy:


“Tank. Tank. Tank.”

helicalenzyme,"Ivan and the Bear ||| Ivan buys a shotgun and goes hunting. While he’s out in the woods, he spots a magnificent brown bear, at least two meters tall. He takes aim and shoots.
    
**BLAM!** The bear drops to the ground. Ivan runs over to where the bear fell… no bear. Someone taps him on the shoulder. He turns around, and it’s the bear.
    
The bear snarls, “Did you just shoot at me?”
   
“Uhhh, yeah.”
    
“Alright, now you gotta blow me.”
    
What can Ivan do? It’s suck bear cock or be ripped apart and devoured. So, he holds his breath and blows the bear. He licks and sucks for what feels like hours. At last, the bear grunts, spooges all over Ivan’s face, taps him on the shoulder appreciatively, and ambles away contented.
    
The next week, Ivan goes to the black market, buys a Kalashnikov assault rifle, and goes hunting again. Soon he comes across enormous bear tracks. He follows them for a couple of hours till he comes across the same brobdingnagian bear. He switches the selector to full auto, takes careful aim, and pulls the trigger.
    
**RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!!!** The bear drops. Ivan dashes toward the bear… no bear. There’s another tap on his shoulder. It’s the bear come up behind him.
    
“Did you just fire a machine gun at me?”
    
“Uhhh, yeah.”
    
“Alright, now I’m going to fuck you in the ass!”
    
What can Ivan do? It’s take bear cock up the ass or be ripped apart and devoured. So he bends over and takes it like a man. The bear diddles him for what feels like hours. At long last, he grunts, spooges all over Ivan’s backside, taps him on the shoulder appreciatively, and ambles away contented.
    
Now, Ivan is really mad. The next week, he travels to an obscure ex-Soviet republic and buys himself a shoulder-mounted SAM-20 missile. He’s going to kill that infamous bear once and for all, no matter what it takes. He returns to the woods and tracks the bear. He aims the missile and launches it at the ursine degenerate.
    
**BOOOOOOOM!!!** The bear drops. Ivan sprints towards it… no bear. A tap on his shoulder. Yep, it’s the bear.
    
The bear sticks his paw in his mouth and blows a shrill whistle. At once, four other bears converge upon the hapless hunter. They pant and grunt as they amble towards him. Their beady eyes radiate with a lewd glare. Their monstrous leader stares at Ivan and drawls,

With the last chime of the clock at midnight, the Warrens hear footsteps coming towards the bed, getting louder with every passing moment. A tall demonish figure reaches the bed, takes something out of his jacket, looks at it and makes an angry grunt.

After about 10 minutes they had done it, the fire was out. The mayor of the town congratulated the firemen and awarded them the key to the city and $10,000.

After just a few seconds of this the vet takes a step back and says ""I'm sorry ma'am, but this duck is dead."" The woman exclaims ""What? You've barely examined him! Is there anything else you can do? He's not dead, he's just sick! I'm sure of it!"" The vet exhales and reluctantly, opens the door, and leads in a large dog. He motions for the dog to get on the table, after which the dog begins to sniff the duck up and down. The duck still lies motionless. After a few minutes of this the dog hops back down, walks back over to the vet and nods his head.

The vet leads the dog back out of the room but this time returns with a cat. The vet leads the cat to the duck, and in a similar fashion the cat begins to sniff the duck up and down. After a minute or two, the cat jumps off the table, walks to the vet, and nods his head. All the while the duck still remains lifeless on the table.

One who'll call, not wait for weeks.. 
I pray he's rich and self-employed,

Pull out my chair and hold my hand..
Massage my feet and help me stand.

In the hope that she will get to see them some day, she leaves her personal information with the adoption agency just in case the boys want to meet their biological mother in the future. One of the boys gets adopted by a family in Egypt and is named “Ahmal.” The other was taken in by a family in Spain, and they name him “Juan.” She hopes that their new lives will have more to offer them, and that they will be happy there.

As luck has it, Juan decides one day that he wants to reconnect with his birth mother. He gets her information from the agency and sends her a picture of himself. Upon receiving the picture she is absolutely thrilled to see how he has grown, how handsome he is, and how happy he seems to be.

jayamshah99,"Always a hole behind ||| A man, while playing on the front nine of a complicated golf course, became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her, explained his confusion and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. She replied, ""I'm on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole."" He thanked her and went back to his golf. 

On the back nine the same thing happened and he approached her again with the same request. She said, ""I'm on the 14th, and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 13th."" Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. 

He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. 

He approached her and said, ""Let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help. I understand that you are a sales lady ... well, I am in sales also. What do you sell?"" 

She replied, ""If I told you, you would only laugh."" 

""No I wouldn't,"" he said and persisted that she tell him what she sold. 

""Well if you must know"", she answered, ""I sell Tampons."" 

With that, he fell on the floor and laughed so hard he almost lost his breath. 

She said, ""See I knew you would laugh."" 

""That's not what I'm laughing at,"" he replied, ""I'm a toilet paper salesman, so I'm still a hole behind you!""",429,2015-06-16

“Roberto, how did you get those black eyes?”


“Well Juan, you know how I’ve been attending that new church?  Two Sundays ago I went to service and there was a beautiful behemoth of a woman sitting in the pew in front of me wearing a very nice sun dress.  Everything was going normally. The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After 20 minutes he told us to stand up and I noticed that the women’s dress had worked its way into her ass crack.  Being the thoughtful guy I am, I casually reached over and plucked her dress from the crevasse it had become lodged in.  As soon as she felt her dress move, the woman turned around and punched me right in the eye!”


“Ouch!” said Juan. “That must have hurt! But how did you come by the second black eye?”


“Well Juan, the very next Sunday I returned to church.  This time I took my cousin Manny with me.  Sure enough, the same woman was sitting directly in front of us.  I promised myself that no matter what happened I was not going to let last week’s incident happen again.  The pastor told us to stand up, we stood up.  He told us to sit down, we sat down.  After some time he told us to stand up and sure enough that women’s dress had migrated back into her ass crack.  Before I could say anything my cousin Manny reached up and plucked the dress from its prison!  Quick as lightning I extended my hand and shoved that dress right back where it came from, shouting ‘Put it back in!’”

So, the new monk goes to the head monk to ask him about this. He points out that if there was an error in the first copy, that error would be continued in all of the other copies. The head monk says, ""We have been copying from the copies for centuries, but you make a good point, my son.""

So, he goes down into the cellar with one of the copies to check it against the original. Hours later, nobody has seen him. So, one of the monks goes downstairs to look for him. He hears sobbing coming from the back of the cellar and finds the old monk leaning over one of the original books crying. He asks what's wrong.

At lunchtime, make him a warm, nutritious meal and put him in a good frame of mind before he goes back to work.

They are on the couch making out when he slips a hand up her skirt and discovers there are no panties. Excited he starts rubbing her and after a bit works a finger in there.

She is getting a bit more aggressive and is clearly having a good time so what the hell he works his other two in leaving his thumb to work her clit. Well the girl is having a blast and is beginning to moan a bit. She starts asking for more. The guy is not all that drunk and kinda intrigued he figures “what the hell let’s see where I can take this.” He starts to work his other hand up beside the first one a few minutes goes by and he has everything but his thumbs in this girl and she is getting really loud now. She’s moaning away grabbing her tits and yelling more! More. So the guy pulls back a bit on his hands and works his thumbs in. After a few more minutes he’s wrist deep and beginning to get concerned. What the hell is going on here? Who is this girl and how was I ever going to satisfy her anyways? Meanwhile she has her heals on the couch and is trusting herself up and down screaming more, more! So he starts pushing away on his hands and he gets to his elbows. He is deeply concerned about being swallowed whole and is no longer comfortable with the situation and yet completely enraptured by the idea of how far this can possible go. So he keeps pushing away when all of the sudden he pots up to his shoulders. Clearly this chick is hollow. She must be built like a pylon. He is reminded of Russian doll figurers who are completely hollow and have another person inside of them. He has a quick thought about how this little 5’6 lady must have a vortex to a different dimension in her that is feeding her excitement at the cost of his limbs.

Bushwacker61,"When I was 10 ||| Around age 10 my dad got me one of those little badass compound bow beginner kits. Of course, the first month I went around our land sticking arrows in anything that could get stuck by an arrow. Did you know that a 1955 40 horse Farmall tractor tire will take 6 rounds before it goes down? Tough sumbich.

   That got boring, so being the 10 yr. old Dukes of Hazard fan that I was, I quickly advanced to taking strips of cut up T-shirt doused in chainsaw gas tied around the end and was sending flaming arrows all over the place.

   One summer afternoon, I was shooting flaming arrows into a large rotten oak stump in our backyard. I looked over under the carport and see a shiny brand new can of starting fluid (Ether). The light bulb went off in my head.

   I grabbed the can and set it on the stump. I thought that it would probably just spray out in a disappointing manner. Lets face it, to a 10 yr old mouth-breather like myself, (Ether), really doesn't ""sound"" flammable.

  So, I went back into the house and got a 1 pound can of pyrodex (black powder for muzzle loader rifles).

   At this point, I set the can of ether on the stump and opened up the can of black powder. My intentions were to sprinkle a little bit around the (Ether) can but it all sorta dumped out on me. No biggie, a 1 lb. pyrodex and 16 oz (Ether) should make a loud pop, kinda like a firecracker you know?   You know what? Screw that I'm going back in the house for the other can.

   Yes, I got a second can of pyrodex and dumped it too. Now we're cookin'.  I stepped back about 15 ft and lit the 2 stroke arrow. I drew the nock to my cheek and took aim. As I released I heard a clunk as the arrow launched from my bow. In a slow motion time frame, I turned to see my dad getting out of the truck... OH SHOOT! He just got home from work. So help me God it took 10 minutes for that arrow to go from my bow to the can. My dad was walking towards me in slow motion with a WTF look in his eyes. I turned back towards my target just in time to see the arrow pierce the starting fluid can right at the bottom. Right through the main pile of pyrodex and into the can. Oh shoot.

  When the shock wave hit it knocked me off my feet. I don't know if it was the actual compression wave that threw me back or just reflex jerk back from 235 fricking decibels of sound. I caught a half a millisecond glimpse of the violence during the initial explosion and I will tell you there was dust, grass, and bugs all hovering 1 ft above the ground as far as I could see. It was like a little low to the ground layer of dust fog full of grasshoppers, spiders, and a worm or two.

   The daylight turned purple. Let me repeat this... THE FRICKING DAYLIGHT TURNED PURPLE.

  There was a big sweetgum tree out by the gate going into the pasture. Notice I said ""was"". That son-of-a-bitch got up and ran off.

   So here I am, on the ground blown completely out of my shoes with my thundercats T-Shirt shredded, my dad is on the other side of the carport having what I can only assume is a Vietnam flashback: ECHO BRAVO CHARLIE YOU'RE BRINGIN' EM IN TOO CLOSE!! CEASE FIRE. DAMN IT CEASE FIRE!!!!!

   His hat has blown off and is 30 ft behind him in the driveway. All windows on the north side of the house are blown out and there is a slow rolling mushroom cloud about 2000 ft. over our backyard. There is a Honda 185 3 wheeler parked on the other side of the yard and the fenders are drooped down and are now touching the tires.

   I wish I knew what I said to my dad at this moment. I don't know - I know I said something. I couldn't hear. I couldn't hear inside my own head. I don't think he heard me either... not that it would really matter. I don't remember much from this point on. I said something, felt a sharp pain, and then woke up later. I felt a sharp pain, blacked out, woke later....repeat this process for an hour or so and you get the idea. I remember at one point my mom had to give me CPR. and Dad screaming ""Bring him back to life so I can kill him again"". Thanks Mom.

   One thing is for sure... I never had to mow around that stump again, Mom had been bitching about that thing for years and dad never did anything about it. I stepped up to the plate and handled business.

   Dad sold his muzzle loader a week or so later. I still have some sort of bone growth abnormality, either from the blast or the beating, or both.

   I guess what I'm trying to say is, get your kids into archery. It's good discipline and will teach them skills they can use later on in life.

The men sit beside each other, start hammering down drinks, and hit it off. After much laughing and joking the black haired man gets serious. He whispers to the other, 
"" you know, i heard the updraft on the side of this cliff is so strong, you can catch it in your coat and fly back to the bar.. I've always wanted to try it..""
The brown haired man laughes it off as a crazy idea, and they continue to drink. However after another half hour of heavy drinking both men are sufficiently plastered, and the blacked haired man leans in again to slur out,
""Really though man, i bet you ten bucks i can jump off that cliff and fly back to the top!""
The brown haired man is just drunk enough now to become interested, so skeptically he follows him outside. 
""Here's what I'm gonna do,"" the black haired man exclaims between burps and sways "" I'm gonna jump off that cliff, catch the air, and I'm gonna fly back up here!""
And without missing a beat, he sprints towards the edge and throws himself off as the the brown haired man looks on, horrified. Not seconds after, despite all odds, the black haired man soars back onto the cliff, coat billowing in the strong wind. 
Shocked and amazed, the brown haired man asks him to do it again, and a third time, sure enough he always ends up flying safely back to the bar.
""My god I've got to try this my self!"" screams the brown haired man, as he runs to the cliff, throws himself off, and plummets 200 feet to his death. Just as the splat is heard, the bartender comes out shaking his head at the black haired man, and says

He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. 

But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. 

At this point they decided to try for 50%. 

The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.

They laughed, they hit on cute girls, they partied hard. They had a final exam Monday morning, so late Sunday night they packed it up and drove home.
Monday morning rolls around, and they all sleep in, and miss the exam. When they wake up, phone calls are made, and they decide that they will tell their prof. about the weekend road trip, but tell him that they got a flat on the way home on Sunday afternoon, didn't have a spare, and could not get back in time for the exam, since there were no tire shops open to fix their flat. 
So, they all troop down to the prof's office, tell him their tale of woe, and ask to be allowed to write the exam the next day. The Prof agrees to let them, and they head home feeling pretty good.
Tuesday morning comes around, and the buddies show up for their exam. The prof sets them up in four separate study rooms, and gives them each a test. The first page is some pretty basic multiple choice questions, worth 10%. At the top of the second page it says:

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador sitting there.

“You talk?” he says.
“Yep” the dog replies.

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog speak, he says “So, what’s your story?”

The Lab looks up and says, “Well. I discovered I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.”

“I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running, but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.”

“I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I’m retired.”

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.

“Ten dollars.” the guy says.

“Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?”

He explains that last year two hunters convinced the pilot to carry two moose and the plane went down, killing the pilot and seriously injuring the hunters.  The two men agree to these terms and they are off.  The guide drops them off and says he'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

The men thank him for the ride and then continue on their way to find a moose.  They go looking for one, and find it with an hour.  They carefully take aim and down the moose.  Concerned that they have to wait another day for the plane to come back, the decide to continue on to find another.  They drag it back the the runway and start again.

The next morning they kill the second moose, drag it to the runway beside the first, and wait.  When the pilot returns he is concerned.  He explains that he cannot take two moose in the plane.  The two guys get angry, and tell him that they are small enough that it will be fine.

The pilot reluctantly agrees.  After they take off, the plane is obviously struggling.  They dip down slowly, and a bit more, until the wing clips a tree and they crash into the ground.  The pilot immediately dies.

While at the fair, he met another farmer who owned five male pigs. After talking a bit, they decided to mate the pigs and split everything 50/50. As the farmers lived 60 miles from each other, they agreed to meet halfway and find a field in which to mate their pigs.

The first morning the farmer with the female pigs got up at 5 AM, loaded the pigs into the family station wagon, and drove the 30 miles. 

While the pigs were mating he asked the other farmer, “How will I know if they’re pregnant?” 

The other farmer replied, “Tomorrow morning, if they’re in the grass grazing, then they’re pregnant. If they’re in the mud, they’re not.”

The next morning they were rolling in the mud, so the farmer called the other farmer, hosed his pigs off; loaded them into the family station wagon and drove off to try again. 

The following morning, it was mud again! This continued for a week until one morning the farmer was so tired he couldn’t get out of bed.

He called out to his wife, “Honey, please look outside and tell me if the pigs are in the mud or in the field.” 

“Well, neither,” yelled his wife. “They’re all in the station wagon and one of them is honking the horn.”",15,2015-06-18

One day a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk and glances at the loaves of bread behind the counter. Noticing the length of her skirt and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea. ""I'd like some raisin bread please"", the man says politely. The female clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. The young man standing almost directly beneath her is provided with an excellent view, just as he surmised he would be. 




Once she descends the ladder he muses that he really should get two loaves as he's having company for dinner. As the clerk retrieves the second loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices whats going on. Thinking quickly, he requests his own loaf of raisin bread so he can continue to enjoy the view. With each trip up the ladder the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. Pretty soon each male patron is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down. After many trips shes tired, irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try this bread for herself!



 Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the crowd staring up at her.

After a few drinks, the fifth is diminished and the G is out flat. An F comes in and tries to augment the situation, but is not sharp enough.

A D comes into the bar and heads straight for the bathroom saying, ""Excuse me. I'll just be a second.""
An A comes into the bar, but the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor. Then the bartender notices a B-flat hiding at the end of the bar and exclaims: ""Get out now! You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight.""

Eventually, the C sobers up, and realizes in horror that he's under a rest.

When she couldn’t stand it any more, she called-out, “Why are you rowing a boat in the middle of the field?”

Stopping her efforts for the moment, the blond in the boat responds, “Because it’s an ‘ocean’ of wheat!”

The blond standing on the side of the road is furious! She yells at the rower, “It’s blondes like you that give the rest of us a bad name!”

The woman in the boat just shrugs her shoulders and begins to row again.

ivo09,"A hurricane comes unexpectedly. ||| The ship goes down and is lost. A man finds himself swept up on the shore of an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing. Only bananas and coconuts. Used to five-star hotels, this guy has no idea what to do, so for the next four months he eats bananas, drinks coconut juice and longs for his old life. He fixes his gaze on the sea, hoping to spot a rescue ship.

One day, as he is lying on the beach, he spots a movement out of the corner of his eye. It's a rowboat, and in it is the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen. She rows up to him.

In disbelief, he asks her, 'Where did you come from? How did you get here?'

'I rowed from the other side of the island,' she says. 'I landed here when my cruise ship sank.'

'Amazing,' he says. 'I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many are there? You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you.'

'It's only me,' she says, 'and the rowboat didn't wash up; nothing did.'

He is confused. 'Then how did you get the rowboat?'

'Oh, simple,' replies the woman. 'I made the rowboat out of materials that I found on the island. I whittled the oars from the gumtree branches. I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides and stern came from a coconut tree.'

'B-b-but that's impossible,' stutters the man. 'You had no tools or hardware. How did you manage?'

'Oh, that was no problem,' replies the woman. 'On the other side of the island there is a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into the forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware. But enough of that,' she says. 'Where do you live?'

Sheepishly, he confesses that he has been sleeping on the beach the whole time. 

'Well, let's row over to my place then,' she says.

After a few minutes of rowing she docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to the shore he nearly falls out of the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white. While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only state ahead, dumbstruck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, 'It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down, please; would you like a drink?'

'No, no thank you,' he says, still dazed. 'I can't take any more coconut juice.'

'It's not coconut juice,' the woman replies. 'I have a still. How about a pina colada?'

Trying to hide his amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk.

After they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, 'I'm going to slip into something comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave?' There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom.'

No longer questioning anything, the man goes into the bathroom. There in the cabinet is a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened onto its end inside a swivel mechanism.

'This woman is amazing,' he muses. 'What next?'

When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines - strategically positioned - and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons him over to sit down next o her.

'Tell me,' she begins, suggestively, slithering closer to him, 'we have been out here for a very long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for all these months. You know...'

She stares into his eyes. He can't believe what he is hearing.

iamcooool,"Reply to ""Classic joke for our Muslim friends today"" ||| Original Post :-

There were two white christian men, John and Mike, whose plane crashed into a desert. Luckily they survived unharmed. As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.
As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.
So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.
John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.
The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.
Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)

They are each given an option;

""You can either complete our two trials, fail and we'll kill you and eat you or don't take part in the trials and we'll kill you and eat you right now.""

All three decided the trials were a better option. 

""So what is the first trial?"" one said.

""Go into the forest and gather 10 of the same kind of fruit then return"" said the Chief.

""Easy enough"" said the men and were escorted into the forest to gather fruit.

The first of the three men chose to gather apples and it did not take him too long so he returned promptly.

""What is the next trial?"" he asked the Chief.

""Now take those 10 fruit, insert them into your anus and do not make any noise, fail and be eaten.""

Shocked but with no option the man began to insert apples into his anus. After the third apple he couldn't help but wince in pain. He was killed and thrown into a cooking pot.

The second of the men returned having gathered 10 small berries off the ground. He too was told the second trial required inserting them into his anus without making a sound.

Easily enough the berries went in. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. And on the 9th berry the man burst out into laughter, was killed and thrown into the pot.

At the gates of heaven, the first guy observed what had just happened and when his friend joined him to enter the pearly gates he had to ask;

""You had 9 berries in your anus then burst out laughing! You were nearly free! Why did you laugh?""

To which the other guy responded;

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking.  How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

So God agreed......
On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh.  For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years?  That's a pretty long time to perform.  How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family.  For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years.  How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again......
On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.  For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years?  Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God.  ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.  For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.  For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren.  And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

 Sheniqua was excited about her upcoming birthday. She told her mother that uncle Leroy was going to take her to Florida for her birthday. Her mother asked Leroy if this was true. Leroy said “No. I told her when she turned seventeen I was goin to tampa with her.” 

Why are there only 2 pall bearers at a thug’s funeral?

She looks at the array of dildos and says, ""How much for the white dildo?""  The guy says, ""$90"".  She looks a bit further and says, ""How much for the black one?""  He says, ""$90, black or white, we don't discriminate.""  She says, ""Okay - since that's the case, I've never had a black one before, so I think I'll take that.""  So she pays her $90, and leaves with a black dildo.

A short while later, a black woman enters the store, and begins looking over the array of dildos.  She asks, ""How much for the black dildo?""  The guy says, ""$90"".  She looks a bit further and says, ""How much for the white one?""  He says, ""$90, black or white, we don't discriminate.""  She says, ""Okay - since that's the case, I've never had a white one before, so I think I'll take that.""  So she pays her $90, and leaves with a white dildo.

A little while later, a blonde walks in.  She asks, ""How much are your dildos?""  The guy says, ""$90 for black, $90 for white - we don't discriminate, lady.""  She looks a bit further on the shelf and her eyes widen.  She says, ""Is... is that a *plaid* one?!""  The guy looks at the shelf, and says, ""Yes, yes it is.

EA7_THI5,"The rabbit, the bear, and the wish granting frog (My first post, please be gentle) |||   A rabbit was sitting in the forest straining to expel the demons caused from a bad meal he had eaten the night before, when he heard a rustling in the bush not far from him. Knowing he was near the bottom of the food chain, he tried to hurry it up.

  Just as the rabbit finished his business, a bear stuck his head through the bush and immediately saw him. Both of them were off like lightening, the rabbit trying to save his fur and the bear trying to land an 'easy meal'. Through the forest the rabbit ran, darting left and dodging right with the bear close in tow at every turn. As the bear closed the gap and started closing in to catch his meal, they ran into an open field and bounded over a slender creek. No sooner were they over the creek when they heard a deep and throaty ""STOP!!""

  Not used to hearing such a sound, they both come to a screeching halt, tumbling over each other. On the bank of the creek was the largest bull frog either of them had ever seen.

  The frog spoke again and said ""You two are pretty loud, running around. Normally I would be annoyed because I was napping in the sun, but you two saved my life from the hawk that was going to snatch me by waking me up.""

  ""Umm...your welcome?"" uttered the bear, keeping an eye on what would still hopefully be his next meal. 

  ""It just so happens I am a wish granting genie and while I am on hiatus, I feel I owe you both for saving my life. I will grant you both three wishes, in succession of course, as a means of gratitude. Ok, who is going first?""

  The bear, unable to contain his excitement, jumped in front of the rabbit and managed to yelp out ""ME, ME!!"" 

  ""Ok bear, what will it be?""

  ""Mating season is tough, with all the competition. I think if you could make all the bears in this forest female, except for me, that would make things easier.""

  ""Done,"" claimed the frog. ""Now rabbit, what can I grant for you?""

  ""I want a helmet,"" he stated, matter-of-factly. The frog, having heard very odd requests in his time, granted the wish with barely a second thought.

  ""Ok bear, time for your second wish. What will it be?"".

  ""Oh man, I thought about it and realized it would be easier if all the bears in the surrounding forests where female too!"" he exclaimed.

  ""Nice wish,"" and with that, the frog made it so. He turned back to the rabbit, asking ""what is your next wish?""

  ""I want a motorcycle."" The frog and the bear looked at each other and exchanged a 'WTF' look. True to his word though, the frog granted the outlandish wish.

  ""Alright bear, you have been on a roll today. What is your last wish?""

  ""Wow, I feel like I wasted my first two but this last one will make up for it. I WISH ALL THE BEARS IN THE WORLD WERE FEMALE!...except for me of course.""

  With the same amount of fervor and excitement the frog exclaimed ""DONE!"" Looking back to the rabbit, feeling a bit annoyed, the frog asked ""What else could you possibly want?"" 

   The rabbit strapped on his helmet, jumped on the motorcycle, looked straight in the bears face and yelled ""I WISH THE BEAR WAS GAY!"" and was out of sight before either of them knew what had happened.

""Can we fit it into the van?"" Jim yells back.

""I think so. Both of us will have to carry it into the trunk, though.""

""Okay, let's keep looking.""

They continue to look, and Jake makes his way to the master bedroom, where he finds a large wardrobe. Upon opening it, he finds an array of fine clothes. Standing out particularly is a long, South Asian, ornamental drape. Obviously, it was formal wear for the wife.

""Hey, Dave!"" Yells Jim, ""I found some piece of Indian women's clothing. It looks really valuable!""

""Can we fit it in the van?"" Dave yells back.

""Yeah,"" Jim replies, ""but we should both carry it to keep it from touching the ground.""

""Okay, good,"" says Dave. ""Now, let's keep-""

They are both interrupted by the sound of car going up the driveway. 

""Oh, shit!"" Yells Jim. ""They're back! We need to get out of here!""

""Wait! We can't just leave with nothing!"" Dave yells back.

Jim is nearly hysterical. ""Well, what do we take then? All we've found that's valuable, we need to both carry!"" 

And now Dave is torn. And he thinks. And he thinks. He's thinking so fast, time is slowing down around him. And then he finally reaches a conclusion. ""Come down here. We're leaving behind the clothing.""

""Well, why?""

""Better safe than sari.""

Unfortunately the lights are not working and it is pitch dark. While in the dark, a loud slap can be heard and when the train finally leaves the tunnel, the French is rubbing his cheek in anger.

The nun thinks: ""Well of course, the French tried to touch the young woman. And the poor girl had to defend herself slapping him.""

The young woman thinks: ""The French must have tried to touch me, but the nun probably saw it and hit him before he could reach me. Thank God.""

The French thinks: ""That was probably the nun slapping me for thinking that I would touch the young girl, when really it was the German trying to make a move"".

Girthquakenz,"Labour pains vs getting kicked in the nuts ||| I mowed the lawn today, and after doing so I sat down and had a cold beer. The day was really quite beautiful, and the drink facilitated some deep thinking on various topics. Finally I thought about an age old question: Is giving birth more painful than getting kicked in the nuts?
Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts. Well, after another beer, and some heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with the answer to that question.
Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby; and here is the reason for my conclusion.
A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""
On the other hand, you never hear a guy say, ""You know, I think I would like another kick in the nuts.""",11,2015-06-20

Days after the surgery, the rich man hands his friend an envelope. Eagerly, he opens it. What he finds is a $50 gift card to a local restaurant. Dumbfounded, the Jewish friend asks the rich man, ""I don't understand... I gave you a little of my blood and in exchange, you give me a brand new Ferrari. But for one of my own kidneys, a much greater sacrifice, you give me this?""

Bushwacker61,"It started out innocently enough. |||  I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.

I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.

I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.

I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?""

Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.

I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, ""Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about.

I came home early after my conversation with the boss. ""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking...""

""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!""

""But Honey, surely it's not that serious.""

""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!""

""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door.

I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed.

To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.

As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.

Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.

I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking. 

And today I joined the Democratic party!

""Well,"" Dad says, ""Think of it this way. I'm the president, Mom is the Congress, our maid is the work force, and your little brother is the rest of the citizens in the United States.""

""I don't think I get it,"" says Little Johnny, thinking about this observation.

""Why don't you sleep on it, then?"" Dad says. Little Johnny nods his little curious head, wishes Dad goodnight, and heads to bed.

Around 1:00 A.M., Little Johnny hears a lamp fall over. Unable to sleep from the frighteningly sudden noise, he goes to his little brother's room to see what's going on.

The small child is lying in his crib, and apparently, he knocked over a lamp, which was shattered all over the floor. ""Oh dear,"" says Little Johnny, when he sees that his little brother crapped his diaper. He decides to go get Dad.

Little Johnny runs to his parents' large bedroom. He creaks open the door, and sees Mom sleeping, but no Dad! Little Johnny exits to find Dad, searching more of his large house. Eventually, he makes it to their maid's bedroom. Looking through the keyhole, he sees Dad ""doing"" the maid. She seems to enjoy it.

Little Johnny jumps into the air in delight. ""Now I get it,"" he yells happily, ""So the Congress is asleep, the President is screwing the Work Force, AND THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE FULL OF SH*T!!""",31,2015-06-21

Man asked the guide why? 


Guide: Give him something to eat.


Man gave him a peanut, monkey took the peanut, shove it in its ass and then ate it.


Man: what is so intelligent in it?



Guide: Months ago, an Englishman came here, gave him a mango, this fucker swallowed it whole, the seed got struck in his ass, he had problems getting it out so now first he checks if it will get out easily and then eats it.


Man: Cool




The man visits the same zoo after months only to find that a ""Super Intelligent monkey"" was written over the cage of that monkey.





Man: What now, how is he super intelligent now?



Guide: Give him something to eat.



Man gave him a grape, monkey took the grape, dipped it into a water bowl, shoved into his ass and then ate it.


Man: How does that make him superintelligent?



Guide: That Englishman returned last month, saw this monkey, only this time he handed him a lighted CIGARETTE.

Morocco_Llama,"Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger ||| So one day, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Dam, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were sitting together in a bar, kicking back, drinking a few brews, talking about life and talking about the roles they'd played in movies.

As the three men talked, each was surprised to realize that all three of them had grown tired of playing the action hero- shooting the bad guys, pulling off life-threatening stunts, and getting the girl in the end.  The whole scene was just all played out for them.

By chance, Stallone had with him a script that his agent had given to him kind of as a joke.  The script would allow three actors to act out the role of their favorite musical composer.  The three men were delighted, ""This is great! Nobody would ever expect this from us! Let's do it!""  And so the agreement was made. Soon, a big budget studio was attached to the project, Spielberg signed on to direct, everything was falling into place.

On the day of the first pre-production meeting, the actors realized they needed to pick parts. Since Stallone had proposed the idea, he got to choose first.  After thinking for a minute, he declared ""I want to be Beethoven."" The others agreed to let Stallone have Beethoven.

Next, it was Van Dam's turn.  He thought for a moment, then declared, ""I want to play Mozart."" And the others agreed to that as well.

Finally, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger's turn.  After thinking about it for several moments, Schwarzenegger finally declared, *cue Terminator voice*: ""I'll be Bach.""",175,2015-06-21

 God created the dog and said, ""Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""So God agreed.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""
The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""And God agreed.

On the third day, God created the cow and said,  ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""
The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""
And God agreed again. 

On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""
But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God. ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off, and froze. When he heard nothing more, he shook his head and continued.

Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard 'Jesus is watching you.'

Startled, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.

'Did you say that?' he hissed at the parrot.

'Yes', the parrot confessed, then squawked, 'I'm just trying to warn you that he's watching you.'

The burglar relaxed. 'Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?'

'Moses,' replied the bird.

'Moses?' the burglar laughed. 'What kind of people would name a bird Moses?'

I saw Miss Hershey standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and Fifth Avenue when I whipped out my Whopper and whispered, ""Hey Sweetart, how'd you like to Crunch on my big hunk for a Million Dollar Bar?""

Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and it was like pure Almond Joy!

I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds because it was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots.

It was all I could do to hold the Snickers and Crackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream ""Oh Henry, Oh Henry!""

Soon she was fondling my Peter Pan and ZagNut and I knew it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milk Duds clear to Mars that gave her a taste of the old Milky Way.

She asked me if I was into M&M, but I said, ""Hey Chicklet, no kinky stuff."" I said, ""Look you little Reese's Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why don't you take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit 'O' Honey?""

(What a piece of Juicy Fruit she was, too!)

She screamed, ""Oh Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!"" as I rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup.

Well, I was giving it to her Good 'N' Plenty, when all the sudden... my Starburst!

Yeah, as luck would have it, she started to grow Chunky and complained of a Cadbury Egg in her stomach.

Sure enough, nine months later, out popped? Baby Ruth!

He approaches Patricia Wack who deals with the loans in this particular bank and says ""Hi, I'd like a £10,000 loan as I am doing some home renovations"". Patricia is a little bemused, as it is a frog asking for a loan, but she is a polite lady and so continues with the usual procedure: ""We will need some form of collateral in order to issue you with a loan"" The frog replies ""I thought you might say that so I have brought something with me"" and hands Patricia a small, pink, shiny porcelain elephant. Patricia's bemusement grows: ""I'm not sure that we can accept this, do you have any other form of collateral?"" The frog appears mildly frustrated: ""Come on, my father is Mick Jagger and all I want is a £10,000 loan."" So Patricia excuses herself and goes in search of the manager, when she finds him she explains the rather bizarre occurrences: ""There's this frog asking me for a loan and he's given me this small, shiny, pink elephant as collateral – what am I supposed to do!?!""

So Sam came back in four hours and the surgeon said, ""I got done
faster than I expected. John is down at the local pub.""

Sam went to the pub and was amazed to see John throwing darts. ""Wow"" thought Sam,"" that surgeon does excellent work""

A few weeks later, Sam and John were out again, and John accidentally cut his leg off. Sam put the leg in a plastic bag and took it, and John, back to the same surgeon.

Sam returned in six hours and the surgeon said, ""I finished early -

twelve times.

On their wedding night they settle into the bridal suite at their
hotel and the bride says to her new groom, ""Please promise to be
gentle,... I am still a virgin.""

This puzzled the groom, since after twelve marriages he thought that at least one of her husbands would have been able to perform. He asked his new bride to explain the phenomena.

The bride responds...

""My first husband was a Sales Representative who spent our entire
marriage telling me, in grandiose terms, ""It's gonna be great!""

My second husband was from Software Services; he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he would send me documentation.

My third husband was from Field Services who constantly said that
everything was diagnostically ""okay,"" but he just couldn't get the
system up.

My fourth husband was from Educational Services, and he simply said, ""Those who can... do; those who can't... teach.""

My fifth husband was from the Telemarketing Department who said that he had the orders, but he wasn't quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver.

My sixth husband was an Engineer. He told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

My seventh husband was from Finance And Administration. His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn't sure whether or not it was his job.

My eighth husband was from Standards And Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it.

My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, ""I know I have the product, I'm just not sure how to position it!""

My tenth husband was a psychiatrist and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it.

My eleventh husband was a gynecologist and all he ever wanted to do was look at it.

My twelfth husband was a stamp collector and all he ever wanted to do was... God I miss him!

Anxious to strike up a conversation, he blurts out, “So, are you going to Vegas to try your luck?”
She turns and smiles, and says, “Well no, I'm going to the Adult Entertainment Expo.  I guess you could say I'm a movie star. ”
He swallows hard, and is instantly crazed with excitement. Here’s the most sensuous woman he has ever seen, sitting right next to him, going to Vegas, and obviously she’s a porn queen. Struggling to maintain his outward cool, he asks with some awkwardness, ""Oh, I see . . . so tell me, is it true that Italian men make the best lovers?""
The woman blushes.  ""Well no, that would be Jewish men.  They are very romantic and gentle.""
Disappointed but emboldened, Tony then asks, ""Well, I've heard that Italian men are the most well-endowed.""
The woman smiles.  ""I'm afraid that's wrong.  In fact, they tend to be rather, well . . . small.  Native American men are most likely to be big.""
Suddenly, the woman looks slightly embarrassed. “I’m sorry,” she says, “I feel so awkward discussing these things with you, and I don’t even know your name.”

One time, the old man was walking the dog next to railroad tracks and the dog's leash snagged onto one of the tracks. He heard a loud whistle and saw a train zooming right towards them. Frantically, he tried freeing the dog even though the train's whistle grew louder. But alas, he had to give up and watched as the train ran over his poor dog. 
The old man returned home, depressed, and told his wife what happened. The wife was deeply saddened and offered him to make some tea. She put the kettle full of water on the stove and waited for it to boil. As soon as the water began to bubble, the kettle started whistling and woke the dozing old man. Livid, he grabbed a club, stormed into the kitchen and smashed the kettle.

She said, ""I have a Praise. Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him..""

You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that poor Tom must have experienced.

""Tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain. We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place....""

Again, the men in the congregation were unnerved and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom.

""Now,"" she announced in a quavering voice, ""thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

All the men sighed with relief. The Vicar rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.

A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium. He said, ""I'm Tom.""

She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family"".

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom’s thoughts, his son volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you,we are just roommates.”

About a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I’ve been unable to find the silver plate. You don’t suppose she took it, do you?”

He said ,”Well, I doubt it, but I’ll email her,  just to be sure.” He sat down and wrote….

The stripper starts singing!  Full on opera, while she's blowing him.  How is she doing this?  He finishes, she turns the light on, and he says ""how'd you do that?""  The stripper smiles coyly and says, ""That's The Secret!""

The man leaves.  How did she do it?  The question gnaws at him.  The next evening, he returns.  He tracks her down, and says, ""I want The Secret again.""  Same story-- this time, however, she sings ""What does the Fox say?""  Distracting choice of song, but still doesn't answer the question.  The light goes on, he offers to give he another $200 for the answer.  ""My little secret!"" The stripper says.

But he has a plan this time, you see.  Same story- lights go off, she starts blowing him, and she starts singing Moon River.  As soon as she starts, though, he flips the light on.

So, without much care, everyone is sexually active. Because they are old and close to death, they see no need to wear condoms and the home doesn't provide them. Eventually, STDs run rampant in the retirement home. 

The old man doesn't want to live with the discomfort of STDs, but he still wants to be sexually active like everybody else. He meets this nice old lady who seems to fancy him. So, to limit the risk of spreading a disease she satisfies him with handjobs. 

Unfortunately, she can't stroke his member because of the painful arthritis in her wrists, so she just sits there and holds his dong. The old man didn't seem to mind. After all, she was the prettiest woman in the retirement home, and he wasn't getting any diseases. 

But one day the nice old lady walks into the old man's room and catches him with another woman. She felt very betrayed.

There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 

One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. 

She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. 

I walked straight towards my car, My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.""

cachry,"A woman and a man are involved in a bad car accident. |||  A woman and a man are involved in a bad car accident. Both of their cars are totally demolished but amazingly, neither one of them is hurt.

After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, 'Wow, just look at our cars! There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet, be lovers, and live together in peace for the rest of our days.'

The man replies, 'I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God!'

The woman continues, 'And look at this, here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine to celebrate our good fortune.'

Then she hands the bottle to the man. The man nods his head in agreement, opens it, drinks half the bottle, and extends it to the woman. Politely, the woman refuses to accept the bottle.

The man asks, 'Aren't you having any?'

The woman replies, 'No. I think I'll just wait for the police...'",9,2015-06-23

""For example: Thou shalt not commit adultery""

""Oh, non, non, merci, non"", and they send the Angel on his way.



The Angel then goes to the Germans:

""I have new Commandments from God.""

""Ja? Vat do they say?""

""Well for example: Thou shalt not kill""

The Germans shake their heads, ""I think's not, nein, danke!""

Sinatra94,"Four equally qualified applicants interview for a job position... ||| ...and the interviewer says to them all, ""I'm glad you have all made it this far, and honestly I didn't expect all four of you to impress me as much as each of you did. However, you can't all get the job. This final interview will decide who gets the job. I will ask you all the same question, and whoever has the best response gets the job."" 

All of the applicants look at each other and then back at the interviewer. With one final nod to all four of them, he begins the final interview.

""Your final question is..."" the interviewer says, ""...what is the fastest thing in the universe?""

The first applicant sat for no more than a minute to think about his answer. Finally he says, ""A thought! We have thousands a day, and they are so quick, you don't even realize that you are thinking about something sometimes.""

The interviewer repeats the question to the next person.

The second applicant, after short deliberation, says, ""A blink! Much like thoughts, we have several thousand per day and we barely recognize its happening. It has to be so quick that it can stop anything from harming your eye in an instant.""

The interviewer repeats the question to the next person. 

The third applicant says confidently, ""Light. The speed of light it so fast that humans literally cannot reach it ever. It's hard to even fathom the speed of light, but it when you walk into a room and flick on a light it seems instantaneous.""

The interviewer, very impressed by the level of thought that each of the applicants has given with their responses, turns to the final applicant and says, ""Well, what do you think is the fastest thing in the universe?""

Almost immediately the fourth applicant says, ""Diharrea.""

Confused and taken aback, the interviewer says, ""Well I don't know what you could possibly mean by that, but do you care to explain yourself?""

The final applicant nods and explains, ""Diharrea is the quickest thing in the universe because before you can even think, blink, or turn on a fuckin' light, you've already shit your pants.""",21,2015-06-23

Johnny, being young and just as innocent, replied, ""I don't know Janey. I'll ask my dad when I get home today."" 

So later that day after school, Johnny went to his dad and asked him. ""Dad, what's a penis"", he said. His dad laughed a little bit and didn't really know what to do. Finally his dad said, ""You know what Johnny, I could tell you, but instead, I'll show you."" 

So his dad took him to the bathroom, pulled down his pants, and revealed himself to his son. ""This is a penis Johnny"", he said. ""Not only is it a penis, but it is the perfect penis"", he boasted proudly. 

Johnny was happy because he finally knew what a penis was and could share the news with Janey. 

The next day on the bus, Johnny told Janey, ""I asked my dad and finally found out what a penis is"". Janey was equally excited to find out. ""Tell me!"", she said. 

Johnny smiled and said, ""Well Janey, I could tell you, but instead, I'll show you"". So Johnny pulled down his pants and revealed himself to Janey.

He got in touch with the Pope and asked the pontiff whether he could change the words of the Lord's Prayer from ""Give us this day a daily bread"" to ""Give us this day a daily chicken.""

""I can't possibly do that,"" said the Pope.

""Not even for 100,000 dollars?"" asked the Colonel.

""No, not for 100,000 dollars,"" replied the Pope.

Six months on and KFC sales were declining still further. The Colonel was getting desperate and made another call to the Pope. This time he offered 500,000 dollars for the words of the Lord's Prayer to be changed to ""Give us this day a daily chicken.""

Again the Pope refused, ""I can't possibly change the wording of the Lord's Prayer from bread to chicken,"" he repeated.

Another 6 months and KFC sales had reached an all time low. The company was in danger of going out of business. Colonel Sanders made one last attempt to persuade the Pope to change the wording of the Lord's Prayer.

""I'll donate 50 million dollars to the Vatican if you change the word 'bread' to 'chicken' in the Lord's Prayers.""

""That's a lot of money,"" conceded the Pope.

""So you'll do it?""

""I'll have to discuss it with the cardinals.""

So the Pope called a meeting of the cardinals. 

He began, ""I have good news and bad news. The good news is, KFC is going to donate 50 million dollars to Vatican. The bad news is, we lost the Wonder Bread account.""",18,2015-06-23

The bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, ""You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.""
 
The cowboy replies, ""Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is an Airborne Ranger, the other is a Navy Seal, both serving overseas somewhere.

So instead of cashing all of his Yen for Dollars immediately, he goes to the local bank every morning, and hands over 10,000 Yen to the teller and receives $100 USD back. This goes on for several days. 10,000 Yen, $100 USD. 

About a week into it, he goes into the bank, and hands the teller 10,000 Yen. This time, he receives $99 USD. To this, the Japanese man asks the teller (thick Japanese accent) -

Japanese Man:  ""Ahh, why ebery deh yoo gib $100, but todeh yoo gib $99??""

Teller: ""I'm sorry sir. It is due to changes in foreign exchange rates.""

miniclapdragon,"A man walks into a bar and makes a bet with a bartender. ||| ""I'll show you a trick, and if you think the trick is good enough, you give me a drink on the house."" The bartender, having had a pretty boring day, accepts.

The man takes a rat out of his pocket and an equally tiny piano out of his other pocket. He sets the piano on the bar, and the rat jumps up and begins to play ""The Entertainer"".

The bartender is amazed and happily gives the man a free drink. After finishing, the man makes another bet: ""If I show you an even better trick, will you put my entire tab for the night on the house as well?""

The bartender accepts again, thinking that there was no way that the man could produce a better trick. He proceeds to pull a bullfrog out of his pants pocket and sets it down next to the rat. The rat begins to play a different song, and the bullfrog starts to sing along in a crystal clear voice. The bartender is once again amazed, and agrees to pay for the man's drinks for the rest of the night.

An hour later, the man is enjoying his free drinks when a stranger comes up to the man and offers to buy the bullfrog for $100,000. ""Sorry, he's not for sale,"" replies the man. The stranger offers to pay $500,000, and the man reluctantly sells the bullfrog and takes the money. The stranger leaves with glee, and the bartender is furious.

""That frog could've been worth millions of dollars to you, maybe even billions, but you sold it off for a mere five hundred thousand dollars!""

The man smiles and takes a sip of his drink.

The gentleman had a habit of passing the most foul gas that would fill up the house, much to the dismay of his wife. Exasperated, one day the wife told him: ""If you keep farting as much as you do, you are going to fart your guts out of your body!""

""Bah,"" said the old man, ""you're full of it woman.""

The next day, the wife woke up early and began to prepare lunch for the day. She had a fresh chicken with the guts removed, when suddenly, an idea struck her. She went into the bedroom, carefully pulled back her husband's boxers, and put the chicken guts inside. ""That'll teach him to fart all the time,"" she thought.

A few minutes later, the wife heard a shriek coming from the bedroom. Snickering, the wife waited until her husband appeared in the kitchen. ""What happened?"" she asked innocently.

""You know how you said if I kept farting eventually I would fart my guts out?"" the husband replied. ""Well, it happened this morning, but luckily with the help of some Vaseline I managed to get them all back in again.""",2,2015-06-24

Steve Austin, Rick Rude, and Paul E. Dangerously are car pooling together, on their way to a wrestling gig. Now, Steve Austin has a habit of swearing...a LOT. Particularly, taking the Lord's name in vein. He's riding shotgun, Paul is driving, and Rick Rude's in the back. Steve's talking, just shootin' the breeze;

""Ah well hell. This god damn chicken tastes like god damn shit. Who in their right god damn mind would eat this shit?""

So Austin and Paul are laughing, and having a good ol' god damn time. Meanwhile, Rude, an apparent devout Christian in real life is in the back seat turning red. Veins were popping out of his forehead, and the only thing missing was stream coming out from his ears.

Finally, after one too many ""god damns,"" Rude snaps, and says ""PULL THE CAR OVER PAUL!""

So they pull over to the side of the road, and The Ravishing One says to Stone Cold ""Steve, MUST YOU TAKE THE FUCKING LORD'S NAME IN VEIN?!""

Austin instantly feels bad. He apologizes, ""I'm sorry Rick. I had no idea you felt so strongly about religion. I was just shootin' the breeze, trying to have fun, but if it offends you, I will not say that phrase again.""

Rude says ""Thank you very much Steve.""

One dark and stormy night he was traveling back to his hotel when his car died. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed an old monastery nestled in a valley between two mountains. He decided it was his best shot and walked up and knocked on the big front door.

A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to explain that his car broke down and wondered if the monk could help. The monk explained to the man that there were 2 monks at the monastery who used to be mechanics, the monk then told the man to come in and eat dinner with them while the monks worked on his car. The man agreed and ate wonderful homemade soup and homemade bread with the monks. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and after a few moments, the head monk lead the man to his room.

The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had ever been in and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was. The noise eventually stopped and the man laid back down and went quickly back to sleep. In the morning the head monk tapped on his door and told the man that his car was ready. The man thanked him and asked ""What was that beautiful noise I heard last night?"" the head monk apologized to the man and explained ""I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" the man tried again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed but moved on with his life and went home.


10 years later he decided that he had such a great time in the mountains of Eastern Europe he would go back.

Then, one dark and stormy night the man was traveling back to his hotel when his car died. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed the old monastery nestled in the valley between two mountains. The man realized that he had been here before. He decided that the monks had helped him before, maybe they'd help him again.

A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to tell the monk that he had been there 10 years previous and his car died then, and his car died again and asked if the monk could help. The monk invited the man in for dinner while the former mechanics looked at his car. The man agreed and ate the wonderful homemade soup and the wonderful homemade bread with the monks once again. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and the head monk lead the man to his room.

The man opened the door and realized it was the same room. The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had laid in for ten years and quickly fell asleep. In the middle of the night he awoke once again to the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. He couldn't identify what the noise was. The noise eventually stopped and the man laid back down and went back to sleep. In the morning the head monk tapped on his door and told the man that his car was ready. The man thanked him and asked ""I'm sorry but I have to ask, what was that beautiful noise I heard last night?"" the head monk apologized to the man and explained once again ""I am sorry, but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" the man tried again and again but the monk told him once again that he could not tell him. The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and went home.


Ten years later he decided to go back to Eastern Europe once again.

Then, on the last dark and stormy night the man was there, he was traveling back to his hotel when his car died once again. He got out of the car and opened the hood. He checked everything he could think of and couldn't find what was wrong. He pulled out his phone and discovered he had no service. He looked around and noticed the old monastery nestled in the valley between two mountains. The man realized that he had been here before. He decided that the monks had helped him before, maybe they'd help him again.

A monk opened the door and asked ""Yes my child?"" the man proceeded to tell the monk that he had been there 10 years previous and 20 years previous and his car died then, and his car died again and asked if the monk could help. The monk invited the man in for dinner while the former mechanics looked at his car. The man agreed and ate the wonderful homemade soup and the wonderful homemade bread with the monks once again. The head monk came to the man at the end of dinner and told him that his car wouldn't be ready till morning, but they had a free room that he could sleep him. The man agreed and the head monk lead the man to his room.

The man opened the door and realized it was the same room. The man laid in the most comfortable bed he had laid in for ten years and quickly fell asleep.

The man was disappointed and slightly angered but moved on with his life and decided to go home. As the man opened his car door he turned around and knocked on the door again.

The head monk answered ""Yes my child?"" and the man said that he had to know what the noise was. The monk explained once again ""I'm sorry but I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man would not take no for an answer this time and asked the head monk what it would take to become a monk. The head monk told the man to go out and count every blade of grass on earth. And the man looked at the head monk and decided it was worth it.

For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every blade of grass. He counted in yards, he looked in fields, and he even found some in laboratories. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes people would be mowing the grass and he'd get confused by the clippings. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of blades of grass on Earth.

The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count every grain of sand on Earth.""

For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every grain of sand. He counted in sandboxes, he looked in the vast deserts, and he even looked at the golf courses. Sometimes the wind would blow and he'd have to start all over again and sometimes the water would wash away the sand at the beaches. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of grains of sand on Earth.

The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the grains of sand and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""No my child, I am sorry but you are not yet a monk, first you must count all the stars in the sky."" The man was angry, but decided it was worth it.

For 10 long years the man traveled the world counting every star in the sky. He counted every night. Sometimes he would lose track and sometimes he'd fall asleep. The man eventually found what he was sure was the correct number of stars in the sky.

The man returned to the monastery and knocked on the door, the head monk answered the door ""Yes my child?"" the man handed the monk the count of the blades of grass and the monk looked over it and said ""Yes my child, you are correct."" The man jumped for joy and asked ""So I'm a monk now?"" and the monk said ""Yes my child."" The man asked ""Well what is the beautiful noise?"" the monk told him that the noise is behind the large wooden door in the main hall.

The man went to the door and pulled on the door for hours, then the door popped slightly open. The man continued to pull on the door for 3 days and then the wooden door opened.

He looked inside and saw a larger bronze door. He began pulling on the bronze door and after the man pulled on the door for a week it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a month at the end of the month the door was open enough for him to slip through.

He looked inside and saw an even larger silver door. He began pulling on the silver door and after the man pulled on the door for a month and it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for a year at the end of the year the door was open enough for him to slip through.

He looked inside and saw a still larger gold steel door. He began pulling on the steel door and after the man pulled on the door for a year it creaked open slightly, he kept pulling on the door for years and years at the end of the decade the door was open enough for him to slip through.

He looked inside and saw an incredibly large golden door. He began pulling on the gold door and after the man pulled on the door for a decade it creaked open slightly, after all of this a crowd began to form, wanting to see the man pulling on the door forever. He kept pulling on the door for 20 long years and eventually door was open enough for him to get through and it swung smoothly out the rest of the way.

And then he saw what was making the beautiful noise.

atresj,"[NSFW] A Pole, a Russian and a German set a bet with the devil ||| They claim that within half a year each would set up a shop that would have everything in it.

When the time passes, the devil visits the Russian and sees a nice big shopping mall with lots of stores in it. The devil nods in appreciation:

""Nice shop you have here, Nikolai. You sure you have anything I want?

""Da"", the Russian responds.

""Give me 10 pounds of nothing, then.""

""Of nothing? But how? I cannot give you nothing...""

The devil smiles and takes the Russian to hell.

Next the devil visits the German. He sees a huge market, pretty much a size of a city. He is impressed by the sheer view of it but still he decides to test the guy.

""Hey, Sven! Are you sure I can get anything I can think of in your beautiful place?""

""Ja, du kannst.""

""Give me ten pounds of nothing, then.""

The German stares at the devil, confused. He scratches his head and tells the devil that nothing is not something. The devil smiles and takes the German to hell.

Finally the devil goes to visit the Pole. He sees a small wooden cabinet, already partially rotten. He opens the door which fall off in the process and sees a Pole sitting inside reading a magazine.

""Hello, Pole. Do you remember about our bet?""

""Yes, I do. Ask away.""

""OK. I would like you to give me 10 pounds of nothing.""

The Pole looks around, intrigued.

""Look, devil... What do you see in here?""

bcrdi,"Two Redneck ||| Two rednecks, Jake and Bubba, were sitting in a bar one night watching
rasslin' on the tube. At the end of the match was an advertisement. 
A loud, obnoxious character came on screaming about $10,000 dollars in
prize money for anyone who could defeat ""The Killer"".

Jake looked at Bubba, a 6' 4"" giant with a brain the size of a pea,
and got an idea. He told Bubba, ""I bet you could beat that guy. He
doesn't look so rough, and you're no wimp."" Bubba thought about it for
a minute and agreed that he probably could.

The next weekend Jake and Bubba went down to the stadium where the
tournament was being held and signed Bubba up. An old man came over
and started briefing them on the rules of the contest and such. Jake,
seeing Bubba was a bit nervous, asked the old man for any tips. The
old man looked up to Bubba and said, ""Just you watch out for his
pretzel hold. Ain't nobody ever gotten out that thing.""
One by one, the contestants ahead of Bubba went in and came back,
balled up and hurting. Two hours after they arrived, it was finally
Bubba's turn. In the ring, right before the bell rang,

Bubba looked back at Jake and said, ""Don't worry, buddy. I can avoid
that pretzel thing."" But not ten seconds after he had gotten up in
the ring, The Killer laying on top of the contorted ball of Bubba, and
the referee was pounding the mat, counting to ten.

Jake screamed and started walking back to the locker rooms. He was
pissed. He had just shelled out $500 to get Bubba in this contest,
and it didn't last 20 seconds. But right before he got to the door,
the crowd went wild! Jake ran back to the ring to see Bubba with one
foot on top of the unconscious Killer and one arm raised in the air by
the referee. Jake ran into the ring and jumped on Bubba. The crowd was out of control, and Jake and Bubba were $10,000 richer!

Later in the locker room, Jake confessed to Bubba that he didn't see what had happened. Bubba said, ""Well, The Killer got me in his pretzel
hold and I thought all was lost. I hurt like I'd never hurt before,
and all I could hear was the ref slamming his hand down and counting to ten. Then I looked up, and front of me was this big, hairy sack of balls. I had nothing to lose and figured it might even help. So I
stretched a little further and bit down as hard as I could on those
things.""

""Jake,"" Bubba said. ""You wouldn't believe the strength a man gets
when he bites down on his own balls!""

takes off his clothes and starts to wander around. A gorgeous petite
blonde walks by and the man immediately gets an erection. The woman notices his erection, comes over to him and says, ""Sir, did you call for me?"" The man replies, ""No, what do you mean?"" She says, ""You
must be new here, let me explain. It's a rule here that if you get
an erection it implies you called for me."" Smiling she leads him to
the side of the swimming pool, lies down on a towel, eagerly pulls
him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.

The man continued to explore the colony's facilities. He enters the
sauna and as he sat down he farted. Within a few minutes a huge,
horrible, corpulent, hairy man lumbers out of the steam toward him. ""Did you call for me?"" says the hairy man. ""No, what do you mean?""
says the newcomer. ""You must be new here,"" says the hairy man, ""it
is a rule here that if you fart it implies that you called for me.""
The huge man easily spins him around, bends him over a bench and has his way with him.

The newcomer staggers back to the colony office, where he is greeted
by the smiling, naked receptionist. ""May I help you?"" she says. The
man yells, ""Here is my membership card, you can have the key back, 
and you can keep the $500 membership fee."" ""But sir,"" she replies, ""you've only been here for a few hours, you haven't even had the

The Mom buys the bird for her 2 Sons and takes him home. After a few hours of playing with the Bird in the Living Room their father comes home just in time to catch the big Football game, the two sons go outside to play catch.

While outside the one son throws the ball a little too hard and it smashes through the living room window, the Dad goes to the window and screams ""If that shit would of hit me, I would of fucked you up!"" the boys were sent to bed early.

The Dad goes back to watching his game, just as his least favorite player got the ball and starting running he yells at his TV ""Fly Nigga Fly!"" His team eventually won and the Dad goes to bed.

The following Sunday the Family was going to take the Bird to the Vet to get checked out, so they figured they would bring the Bird to Church and head straight to the Vet afterwards.

While at the Church the Bird starts acting up, so the Priest throws a book at the bird. The bird then screams ""If that shit would of hit me, I would of Fucked you up!"" The Priest is appalled by the birds reaction, he says to the bird ""How do you expect to get into Heaven with that mouth?"" the Bird replies ""Fly Nigga Fly!""",5,2015-06-24

I sadly returned to my desk. Then I asked some of my friends what they planned for the weekend.

""Yup! I figured you guys might enjoy it. All we have to do is work our butts off until Friday, spend some vacation time, and have a blast!""

The woman, who is a virgin, says she has no experience with sex and wants her first time to be a memorable one. The man, because she is young and beautiful, obliges, and suggests they leave for Minnesota as soon as possible.

The next day, they got on a bus from New York. The only other passengers were members of a high school hockey team. 

After 100 miles on the road, the bus breaks down and everyone has to get off the bus while it is repaired. While the man and woman wait, the man suggests the two go off into the woods and have a little fun since the bus won't leave for another hour. She is flattered, but says: ""I think we should wait,"" and so they get back on the bus. 

After another hundred miles, the bus breaks down again. Everyone gets off the bus and waits for it to be repaired. Again, the man asks his girlfriend to sneak off while they wait. ""How about now?"" he asks. ""This journey is taking forever and I cannot wait any longer!"" Flattered, she insists they wait until they arrive in Minnesota. Everyone soon gets back on the bus. 

For a third time, the bus breaks down. The man figures it is not worth bothering his girlfriend a third time. ""She might become annoyed and not want to marry me,"" he thinks. Suddenly, she takes his hand, brings him into the woods and she experiences her first time. 

As they are walking back to the bus, the man cannot help but say: ""That was wonderful. You are a skillful lover! But what made you change your mind about having your first time after the wedding?""

IDK, it plays on a dumb stereotype to build a funny image... whatever, I'll hit the other races too, balance out the universe) ",34,2015-06-25

the waiter comes over to bring him the check.
When the waiter arrives at the table, he just
starts to ask 'Would you like any des...' Then the
Panda Bear reaches into his fur, pulls out a gun,
and shoots the waiter dead. The Panda Bear then
wipes off his chin with his napkin, gets up, and
starts to walk out. Just as he is about to go
through the door, the manager grabs him. 'Wait a
minute!' he yells, 'You just killed my best waiter!
Besides that, you didn't even pay for your
sandwich!'

The Panda Bear grasps the manager by the
throat, jacks him up, and growls, 'Hey man! I'm a
PANDA! Do you know what that means? Why
don't you look it up!'

At this the Panda walks out the door and ambles
down the street. The manager, shaken, returns to
his office and consults a dictionary. He reads:
'panda - a large mammal of the Asian mountain
forests related to raccoons and true bears and
characterized by bold black and white markings.
Eats shoots and leaves.'

The pharmacist came over smiled and asked if he could help me.
                                                                                                 
I said, ""Yes!  Could you please taste this for me?""
                                                                                                 
Being I'm a senior  citizen...I guess the Pharmacist just went along with me.  He picked up the spoon and put a tiny bit of the liquid on his tongue and swilled it around.  Then with a stomach-churning look on his face he spit it out on the floor and began coughing.
                                                 
When he finally was finished, I looked him right in the eye asked, “Now, does that taste sweet to you?""
                                                                                                 
The pharmacist, shaking his head back and forth with a venomous look in his eyes yelled, “HELL  NO!!!""
                                                                                                 
So I said, ""Oh thank God! That's a real relief!  My doctor told me to get a pharmacist to test my urine for sugar!""

Jan explains that after leaving high school and graduating from Princeton in Classics, she met and married Timothy, with whom she has a beautiful daughter.

'What majestic trees!'
'What powerful rivers!'
'What beautiful animals!'
He said to himself.


As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him.


He turned to look.  He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him. 

He ran as fast as he could up the path.  He looked over his shoulder & saw that the bear was closing in on him.


He looked over his shoulder again, & the bear was even closer.


He tripped & fell on the ground.


He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw & raising his right paw to strike him. 


At that instant moment, the Atheist cried out: 
'Oh my God!'

Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.


As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky.

'You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don't exist and even credit creation to cosmic accident.' 
'Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament?'

'Am I to count you as a believer?'

The atheist looked directly into the light, and said: 'It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps you could make the BEAR a Christian?'


'Very well', said the voice.


The light went out.  The sounds of the forest resumed.  And the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together, bowed his head & spoke: 

'Lord bless this food, which I am about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.'

For two more weekends Freddie sees this happen the exact same way, and decides he needs to find out this guy's secret. He approaches the man and says ""For four weeks I've seen you take home a beautiful woman every time without fail. You've gotta tell me your secret.""

""Well,"" the man says. ""First I walk up to a woman and whisper in her ear, 'I want to tickle your butt with a feather.' She goes, 'What?!' and then I say, 'How about that weather?'. She thinks I'm just a nice guy asking her about the weather, but she has sex on her mind the whole time.""

NeverGuessItWasMe,"The traveling salesman and the farmer's wife ||| Now Jim was traveling the back woods of Iowa, looking for someone needing a vacuum.  Now late that afternoon, as is want to happen, his car broke down, leaving him stranded.  Now, luckily Farmer Jones came along on his old John Deere, and Jim explained what had happened.  Of course they both realized it was way too late to get him help that evening, so Farmer Jones took him on home.

When they got there, Jim saw it was nothing but a tiny one room shack, without even a decent barn, and he got to thinking he might just have been better staying in the car.  But Farmer Jones assured Jim that they had a big ol' bed for just him and his young wife, and they wouldn't mind lending him some space with them.  Just as Jim got to thinking it over, out walked Mrs. Jones, and damn if she wasn't the prettiest little thing Jim had ever cast his eyes upon.  Of course Jim knew better than to try anything with the farmer's wife, seeing as Farmer Jones was a big ol' boy and all, but that wouldn't stop him from thinking about it anyway.

Well as they were dozing off, Jim on one side of the farmer, and the missus on the other, over the farmer's snoring Jim heard Mrs Jones calling his name.

""Hey Jim, how about you come over here and make sweet love to me?"" Jim was shocked, of course, not believing what he was hearing.  But she told him she was very serious, and that she knew once her husband started snoring, well nothing was going to wake him.  And when he still wasn't sure, she told him to just reach down between his cheeks and pluck out a hair.  After a few more denials, Jim finally gets up the nerve and reaches down.  <BOINK!> the hair came free, and Farmer Jones never even flinched!  

Not believing his luck, Jim immediately hopped over and gave that young woman all he could, then settled back on his own side again.

But, sure enough, not much later he is once again woken by the farmer's wife begging him to give her another round.  But, believing there was no way the farmer could keep sleeping, he wouldn't give in until she had him pluck another hair from his ass.  And sure enough, <BOINK!> not even a change to his snoring.  So, Jim jumped over again and gave her an even wilder ride this time, before once again settling back on his own side.

But again, just as he was dozing off, he heard the farmer's wife calling for more!  This time it took no argument at all ... He just reached down and grabbed another hair from the farmer's ass.  <BOINK!>

But this time, before he could breathe a sigh of relieve, Farmer Jones sits straight up and grabs Jim by the throat.

bcrdi,"Texas ||| An old prospector shuffled into the town of El Indio, Texas leading a tired old mule. The old man headed straight for the only saloon in town, to clear his parched throat.

He walked up to the saloon and tied his old mule to the hitch rail.

As he stood there, brushing some of the dust from his face and clothes, a young gunslinger stepped out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other.

The young gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed, saying, ""Hey old man, can you dance?""

The old man looked up at the gunslinger and said, ""No son, I don't dance... never really wanted to.""

A crowd had gathered as the gunslinger grinned and said, ""Well, you old fool, you're gonna dance now!"" and started shooting at the old man's feet.

The old prospector, not wanting to get a toe blown off, started hopping around like a flea on a hot skillet.

Everybody standing around was laughing.

When his last bullet had been fired, the young gunslinger, still laughing, holstered his gun and turned around to go back into the saloon.

The old man turned to his pack mule, pulled out a double-barreled 12 gauge shotgun and cocked both hammers.

The loud clicks carried clearly through the desert air. The crowd stopped laughing immediately.

The young gunslinger heard the sounds too, and he turned around very slowly.

The silence was deafening. The crowd watched as the young gunman stared at the old timer and the large gaping holes of those twin 12 gauge barrels.

The barrels of the shotgun never wavered in the old man's hands, as he quietly said;

""Son, have you ever kissed a mule's ass?""

The gunslinger swallowed hard and said, ""No sir... but...but I've always wanted to.""

There are a few lessons for all of us here:

*Don't be arrogant.

*Don't waste ammunition.

*Whiskey makes you think you're smarter than you are.

*Always make sure you know who is in control.

*And finally, don't screw around with old folks; they didn't get old by being stupid.",32,2015-06-26

But then that's when I had my epiphany. I realised the only way I could survive these motions through time and space are if my brother has a baby. 

Because then I become an un-kill. 

PS: South Indians probably relate to this joke more.

The man decides to take his chances, pays his fee, and is told to disrobe.  He is escorted to a room adorned like a roman emperor's suite - round bed, mirrored ceilings, heavy drapes, hot tub, sexual toys and enhancements.  In the middle of the room is a nubile young lady, beautiful, and naked except for a sign she holds that says:  ""You catch me, you f*ck me.""

An hour later the man leaves, 5 pounds lighter and unquestionably happier with a spring in his step.

Seeing as he is still overweight, he returns to the office the next day and asks for any other weight loss specials he might take advantage of.  The proprietor tells him there is a more ""rigorous"" option available, the results being a loss of 10 lb in one session, but double the price.  Based on his first session, the man concludes this must involve two female companions - or more!

He again pays his money and is asked to disrobe.  He is led to another door, which opens up into what can only be described as a concrete and steel warehouse.  No bed, no drapes, no opulence.

As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming ""Oh my god, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"" The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation.

The doctor thought for a moment and said ""Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit."" The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said ""Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it.""


So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper."" So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed.


The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud.


The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.

It was autumn, and the Red Indians asked their New Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild.

Since he was a Red Indian chief in a modern society, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his Tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.

But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?'

'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded.

So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Is it going to be a very cold winter?'

'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'It's definitely going to be a very cold winter.'

The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again.

'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' The man replied. 'It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.'

'How can you be so sure?' the Chief asked.
The weatherman replied, 'The Red Indians are collecting wood like crazy.'

He wanted to plant his annual tomato garden, but it was very difficult work, as the ground was hard.  His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison.  The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament.  

""Dear Vincent, I am pretty sad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year.  I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot.  I know if you were here my troubles would be over.  I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.  Love, Papa.""

A few days later, he received a letter from his son.

""Dear Papa,  Don't dig up that garden.  That's where the bodies are buried.  Love, Vinnie""

At 4 am next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies.  They apologized to the old man and left.  That same day, the old man received another letter from this son.

""Dear Papa,  Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now.  That's the best I could do under the circumstances.  Love you, Vinnie""

Bushwacker61,"Ear Infection ||| They often ask at the doctor's office why you are there, and you have to answer in front of others what's wrong  and sometimes it is embarrassing. 

There's nothing worse than a doctor's receptionist who insists you tell her what is wrong with you in a room full of other patients.  

Here's how one old guy handled it: 

A 65-year-old man walked into a crowded waiting room and approached the desk. 

The receptionist said, 'Yes sir, what are you seeing the doctor for today?' 

'There's something wrong with my dick', he replied. 

The receptionist became irritated and said, 'You shouldn't come into a crowded waiting room and say things like that. ' 

'Why not, you asked me what was wrong and I told you,' he said. 

The receptionist replied; 'Now you've caused some embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and discussed the problem further with the doctor in private.' 

The man replied, 'You shouldn't ask people questions in a roomful of strangers, if the answer could embarrass anyone. The man walked out, waited several minutes, and then re-entered.

The receptionist smiled smugly and asked, 'yes??' 

'There's something wrong with my ear,' he stated.

The receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled, knowing he had taken her advice.. 'And what is wrong with your ear, sir?' 

'I can't piss out of it,' he replied.

When they discovered they lived in the same city only a few miles apart Ed was ecstatic. He immediately started asking her out when they got home.

Within a couple of weeks, Ed had taken Nancy to dance clubs, restaurants, concerts, movies, and museums. Ed became convinced that Nancy was indeed his soul mate and true love. Every date seemed better than the last.

On the one-month anniversary of their first dinner on the cruise ship, Ed took Nancy to a fine restaurant. While having cocktails and waiting for their salad, Ed said, 

""I guess you can tell I'm very much in love with you. I'd like a little serious talk before our relationship continues to the next stage.  So, before I get a box out of my jacket and ask you a life changing question, it's only fair to warn you, I'm a total golf nut. I play golf, I read about golf, I watch golf on TV. In short, I eat, sleep, and  breathe golf. If that's going to be a problem for us, you'd better say so now!""

Nancy took a deep breath and responded, ""Ed, that certainly won't be a problem. I love you as you are and I love golf too; but, since we're being totally honest with each other, you need to know that for the last five years I've been a hooker.""

Ed said, ""I bet it's because you're not keeping your wrists straight when you hit the ball.""

A man had just settled into his seat next to the window on the plane when another man sat down in the aisle seat and put his black Labrador Retriever in the middle seat next to the man.

The first man looked very quizzically at the dog and asked why the dog was allowed on the plane.

The second man explained that he was from the  Police Drugs Enforcement Agency and that the dog was a 'sniffing dog'.

'His name is Sniffer and he's the best there is. I'll show you once we get airborne,when I put him to work.'

The plane took off, and once it has leveled out, the Policeman said, 'Watch this.'
 
He told Sniffer to 'search'.
 
Sniffer jumped down,walked along the aisle, and finally sat very purposefully next to a woman for several seconds.  Sniffer then returned to his seat and put one paw on the policeman's arm.

The Policeman said,  'Good boy', and he turned to the man and said, 'That woman is in possession of marijuana, I'm making a note of her seat number  and the authorities will apprehend her when we land.
'Gee, that's pretty good,' replied the first man.

Once again, the Policeman sent Sniffer to search the aisles.

The Lab sniffed about, sat down beside a man for a few seconds, returned to its seat, and this time he  placed two paws on the agent's arm.
The Policeman said, 'That man is carrying cocaine, so again, I'm making a note of his seat number for the police.'

'I like it!' said his seat mate.

The  Policeman then told Sniffer to 'search' again.

Sniffer walked up and down the aisles for a little while, sat down for a moment, and then came racing back to the agent, jumped into the middle seat and proceeded  to poop all over the place.

The first man was really disgusted by this behavior and couldn't figure out how or why a well-trained dog would behave like that, so he asked the Policeman, 'What's going on ?'

The Policeman nervously replied, 'He's just found a bomb.'

By a group of cannibals. These cannibals take the men back to their tribe, to show their king that they brought dinner. 


&nbsp;


The king, a natural gambler, spoke to the men. He said that he will give them a test. This test has two parts, and the second part will be told only once they have completed the first. If they pass, they will be led out of the forest and made free to go. Else, they will be killed and, after preparation with the best seasonings available, eaten.


&nbsp;


The king explains that they will be allowed into the forest with two tribespeople. The men are to go in different directions, and gather ten fruits or vegetables and bring them back.


&nbsp;


The men accept immediately, and off they go into the wild blue yonder.


&nbsp;


About an hour later, Man #1 comes back. He's proud that he found his items so quickly, and he dumps ten apples on the ground in front of the king. ""I'm ready for the second part,"" he says.


&nbsp;


The king explains the second part. When each man comes back with his fruits or vegetables, he is to shove all ten up his ass. The kicker: They are to do this without any face, grimace of pain, or reaction.


&nbsp;


Horrified, Man #1 successfully takes in one whole apple. He almost finishes the second one, but then he winces from the pain. He's killed instantly by a tribe member, and dragged away.


&nbsp;


Some time passes.


&nbsp;


Now, Man #2 is on his way back. He stands before the king, and presents his find: Raspberries.


&nbsp;


The king smiles and explains that he is to insert the raspberries into his ass without any face, grimace, etc. The man, slightly used to this kind of foreplay, obliges. He gets to the ninth raspberry, but then starts laughing uncontrollably. He's of course killed and dragged away.
_____________________________


&nbsp;


These first two men, they meet in heaven. Man #1 has been watching Man #2 since his own death, so naturally he's confused.


&nbsp;


Man #1: ""Hey, why the hell did you laugh? You were doing so well, and could have gone free!""


&nbsp;


Man #2: ""I know, but were you not watching? I looked up, and in the distance I saw [Man #3] coming back with his guides... he found watermelon!""

In a quiet voice the boy spoke ""I was watching porn""

""WHAT?!"" Exclaimed the father ""WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I *NEVER* LOOKED AT PORNOGRAPHY!""

*SMACK*

The wife, who had been watching this whole event unfold chuckled and said ""Well, he *is* your son.""

poopstickboy,"A man needs help doing chores around the house ||| So he asks around saying he needs someone to do the dishes. His friend tells him about this dog. ""He's amazing! He can do all your dishes no problem."" So the man takes the dog home and asks him to do the dishes. The dog does the dishes in no time at all. The man says ""wow you're amazing! How good are you doing laundry?"" The dog says ""I can't do laundry what do you think I am? I'm only a dog"" so the man takes the dog back to his friend and tells him ""This dog is good at dishes but he's useless for anything else. What else do you have?"" His friends thinks for a second and says ""ok I've got the perfect thing for you. Take this parrot. He can do whatever you want."" So the man takes the parrot home and asks him to do the dishes. The parrot gets to work and does an even better job than the dog. He even dries them and puts them away. The man is applauds the parrot and asks about the laundry. The parrot starts laundry with no trouble at all. The man says ""wow you're amazing! How are you at vacuuming?"" The parrot replies ""I can't vacuum what do you think I am? I'm only a parrot."" So the man takes the parrot back to his friend and tells him his problem. The man thinks for a second and says ""ok take this monkey. He can do everything you need him to."" So the man brings him home and the monkey does the dishes and laundry with out complaints. He even vacuums the whole house no problem. The man says ""wow you're amazing! Could you run up the the store and grab me some groceries?"" The monkey says I can't do that what do you think I am? I'm only a monkey."" So the man gets frustrated and takes the monkey back. He asks his friend ""I really need something better."" So his friend thinks long and hard and finally says ""I've got it! Take this milipede. I guarantee he can do anything and everything you can imagine."" The man is doubtful of this little milipede but trusts his friend. He takes the milipede home and explains his chores. The milipede gets to work. He washes the dishes perfectly. Dries them, puts them away, and even organizes the cabinets. He does laundry with no hassle at all. Folds them and neatly puts them in the man's dresser. He even irons the man's dress shirts. He vacuums the entire house, mops the floor, and dusts everything. The man is astonished. He says ""wow you're amazing! Here's my grocery list. Are you capable of getting everything?"" The milipede says yes and walks out the door. The man waits for the milipede to return. He watches the clock as minutes turn to hours. After waiting for what seemed like forever the man gets worried that something happened to the milipede. He goes to look for him and walks out the door to find the milipede still right outside. He angrily says ""what are you doing!? I've been waiting and waiting on you. Why are you still here!?"" The milipede looks up and says ""well sir, I'm still tying my shoes!""",4,2015-06-27

Fruitje,"Superman (NSFW) ||| So, Superman's cruising the skies above Metropolis, just chill in', taking in the views, when all of a sudden he spots a butt-naked Wonderwoman lying on a rooftop, sunbathing, legs wide open.

Being the opportunist he is, S decides to dive down at light-speed to seize this golden opportunity, assuming that doing the dirty deed at that pace will get him some relief in those manly tight pants of his undetected.

Wonderwoman never knew what hit her and once she's regained some clarity asks the invisible man what on Earth just happened.
