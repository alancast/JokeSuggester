Curious, he walks over to the celebrating group, and notices something even odder; a children's jigsaw puzzle with about 20 pieces at most, completed and sitting in a beautiful frame. He taps one of the blondes on the shoulder.

""Excuse me,"" he says, ""But what is the big celebration for?""

They drift on the ocean for a few days before washing up on a desert island. Slowly, they started building a new life on the island: they build a shelter, they find a source of water and food. Everything is going well as they are reaching a nice level of comfort. But after a few weeks, the stewardess goes talking to the steward and the captain and says: ""Guys, we've been living on this island for a few weeks now and we managed to provide for our vital needs, but I know that you, as much as I do, have other needs. So before we begin to fight about it, here's what I'm proposing you: captain, you can do it on the even days of week, and you steward can do it on the odd days of the week. And if there's anything wrong, we talk about it. What do you think? "" They both agree and so begins the sex triangle. They are now happier and more relaxed than before. But three weeks later, the stewardess gets sick and unfortunately dies. But life must go on for the captain and the steward, so they continue to live as they did when they first got on the island. A few weeks later though, the steward says to the captain : ""It's been tough since she died. And I'm tired of jacking myself off. I need to have sex. I can't take it anymore"". The captain looks in horror as to what the steward was implying towards and says ""I don't think I'm comfortable doing that."" Steward then replied ""What other way do we have? Do you want to go back to jacking off? I don't think so.."" The captain agrees and they start satisfying their urges again. But a few days later, the captain comes up to the steward and says: ""-Man you said that if there was anything wrong we'd talk about it right? I must tell you that I don't feel really comfortable with what we're doing here "" ""-Actually me neither. As a matter of fact, I find it weird and against nature "" answers the steward.

* Make up nicknames for all your co-workers and refer to them only by these names.  ""That's a good point, Sparky."" ""No, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Chachie.""

* Send e-mail to the rest of the company telling them exactly what you're doing.  For example: ""If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom.""

* Hi-Lite your shoes.  Tell people you haven't lost them as often since you did this.

* While sitting at your desk, soak your fingers in Palmolive. Call everyone Madge.

* Hang mosquito netting around your cubicle.  When you emerge to get coffee, a printout, or whatever, slap yourself at random the whole way.

* Put a chair facing a printer.  Sit there all day and tell people you're waiting for your document.

* Every time someone asks you to do something, anything, ask him or her if they want fries with that.

* Send e-mail back and forth to yourself, engaging yourself in an intellectual debate. Forward the mail to a co-worker and ask her to settle the disagreement. 

* Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair-dancing.

* Put your trash can on your desk.  Label it ""IN"". 

* Feign an unnatural and hysterical fear of staplers.

Having achieved his aim, Farmer Little starts questioning Farmer Big about his trick for the biggest hog.
Turns out, every year, 2 weeks before the fair, Farmer Big would select his largest hog and cram a #3 thermos cork up the hogs ass to plug him up.  So Farmer Little decided 4 weeks ahead of the fair to cram a #6 thermos cork up his largest hogâ€™s ass.
Shoâ€™ nuff, that year Farmer Littleâ€™s hog one the Blue Ribbon for the first time ever.  As luck would have it, just as the judges were awarding the blue ribbon, the organ grinder came walking by with his monkey.  The monkey looked up at the hogâ€™s ass from his perspective and saw the cork.  Being a curious creature, the monkey reached up and pulled out the cork.  Needless to say, shit flew everywhere as the pig  flew around the room like a balloon when a kid lets go of it.
Farmer Big starts laughing uproariously as the judges unaward the blue ribbon.  A crestfallen Farmer Little says ""it ainâ€™t that funnyâ€ù.  â€œWanna bet?â€ù, Farmer Big says, â€œYou should have seen the look on that monkeyâ€™s face as he was trying to put the cork back in!â€ù

A man is on his way to buy a horse from the local market. Whilst on his journey, he has to walk over a large hill. When he gets to the marketplace, there is a fine looking mare that's on sale for dirt cheap. The man points to the horse and asks if he can buy it. Before accepting his offer, the owner asked the man, ""What route did you take to get here?""

""The one with the big hill"" responds the man.

""Well, I wouldn't take that route back if I was you. There is something funny with this horse. Whenever he's on top of a large hill, he will just sit there and it's impossible to move him. If yer gonna buy him, I'd take a different road home"".

The man buys the horse and thanks the owner. Heeding his advice, he takes a detour home through the woods. All is going well and the horse rides a dream. However, they get to a shallow stream and in the middle of crossing the stream, the horse stops and sits down, refusing to budge.

So Mom reluctantly agrees and on January 20, 2017, Susan Goldfarb is being sworn in as President of the United States. 

In the front row sits the new President's mother, who leans over to a senator sitting next to her.

'You see that woman over there with her hand on the Torah, becoming President of the United States??'

The Senator whispers back, 'Yes I do.'

Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout:

â€œNow that Yahoo has announced theyâ€™re doing away with passwords, Iâ€™m finally at liberty to set the record straight,â€ù said Clinton.  â€œThe one and only reason that I have been using a personal email account to conduct matters of state is because of the State Departmentâ€™s impossible password policy.â€œ

The policy that Clinton refers to is a carryover from the George W. Bush administration.  It requires that passwords of Democratic Party members have least 5 uppercase characters, 9 lowercase characters, 7 numeric digits, 6 non-printable characters, 8 floating point numbers and 4 Shift JIS characters.  Also, passwords cannot appear in a dictionary of any language, they expire twice a day, and the same one can never be used twice.  Republicans, on the other hand, in view of their backing of the Patriot Act, are allowed to use zero-character passwords that never expire.

Clintonâ€™s frustration came to a head after taking a selfie in the Presidentâ€™s Oval Office chair while the President stepped out for a bio break.  â€œI tried to email it to my 2016 election campaign staff as a joke, when I discovered that I was locked out of my email for the third time that morning.

girl leaning into the lion's cage.

Suddenly, the lion grabs her by the cuff of her jacket and tries to pull her
inside to slaughter her, under the eyes of her screaming parents. The biker jumps off his Harley, runs to the cage and hits the lion square on the nose
with a powerful punch.

Whimpering from the pain the lion jumps back letting go of the girl, and the biker brings her to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly.

A reporter has watched the whole event. The reporter addressing the Harley rider says, 'sir, this was the most gallant and brave thing Iâ€™ve seen a man
do in my whole life.'

The Harley rider replies, 'why, it was nothing, really, the lion was behind
bars. I just saw this little kid in danger and acted as I felt was right.'

The reporter says, 'well, Iâ€™ll make sure this won't go unnoticed. I'm a
journalist, and tomorrow's paper will have this story on the front page...so
, what do you do for a living, and what political affiliation do you have?'

The biker replies, 'Iâ€™m a U.S. Marine and a Republican.'

the journalist leaves. The following morning the biker buys the paper to see news of his actions, and reads, on the front page:

I know how this joke works.  No matter how much I tell people they're going to HATE me for telling them this joke, they still insist on wanting to hear it.  Every. Single. Time.  

Why I'm volunteering to get down-voted to Hell, I dunno, but many of those that I tell this joke to eventually run into a situation where they too share this joke (usually at a party to people who are annoying them).  To the best of my knowledge, my friend Dave made this up at a party in high school, while totally baked, and told it for 20 minutes.  (He was telling it to some annoying pretty cheerleader-types, who were trying to be ""cool"" and hang out with / get high with the skateboard guys.  You know the type.  I *think* he made this up on the spot to fuck with him; he didn't give a shit.  I was simultaneously awed and thought it was the funniest shit in the entire world when he was done.  No, I was not also baked.)  Be forewarned, this is a LONG joke, and ya know, the aforementioned hating me at the end:


There once was a man who was the Supreme Emperor of the Universe.  He owned literally every THING, and every person was his slave and every planet his playground.  There was literally nothing he could ever want or couldn't do that wasn't his to be had or to be done.  And this Supreme Emperor had but one son, who he lavished his affection and gifts upon.

And so it came, on the day of his only son's 15th birthday, that he summoned his child to his throne room.

""Son,"" the Emperor said, ""Today is your 15th birthday.  For your present, I will give to you anything you wish to have in my universe.  Whatever your heart's desire, I have the power to make it so.  For what do you wish?  1,000 slave girls to do with as you please?  A planet to call your own?  Whatever you want is yours but to ask.  So my son, what do you wish for on this, your 15th birthday?""

The Emperor sits back on his platinum throne, eagerly awaiting his son's decision, pleased with himself, content with the knowledge that soon he will make his son happy by providing him anything that he desires from his grand empire.

And so, the son thinks long, thinks hard, thinks long some more.... and finally.... comes to a decision.

""Dad?'

""Yes son?

""I have thought about what you have offered.  And I have come to a decision.""

""Yes son, whatever you wish, whatever you want - name it and it is yours - I will command it!""

""I thank you for your generosity father.  For this, my 15th birthday, I would like....

""Yes???""

.... a pink golf ball.""

The Emperor can scarcely believe his son's request.  Incredulously, he says ""Son, I can provide you with all your wildest dreams, anything in this cosmos or the next, all yours but to ask!  And all that your heart desires........ is... a pink golf ball?""

Solemnly, the boy answers.  ""Yes Father, I have thought this through and I am certain: 1 pink golf ball and I shall be content.""

The Emperor, perplexed, nevertheless, grants his son's request.  ""So be it.  I shall provide to you.... a pink golf ball.""

And so it came, in the following year, on the day of his only son's 16th birthday, that he once again summoned his child to his throne room.

""Son,"" the Emperor said, ""Today is your 16th birthday.  For your present, I will give to you anything you wish to have in my universe.  Whatever your heart's desire, I have the power to make it so.  For what do you wish this year?  Do you NOW wish to have 1,000 slave girls to do with as you please?  Or NOW a planet to call your own?  Whatever you want is yours but to ask.  So my son, what do you wish for on this, your 16th birthday?""

The Emperor once again sits back on his platinum throne, eagerly awaiting his son's decision, pleased with himself, content with the knowledge that soon he will make his son happy this year by providing him anything that he desires from his grand empire.

And so, the son thinks long, thinks hard, thinks long some more.... and finally.... comes to a decision.

""Yes son, whatever you wish, whatever you want - name it and it is yours - I will command it!""

""I thank you for your generosity father.  For this, my 16th birthday, I would like....

""Yes???""

.... a case of pink golf balls.""

The Emperor can, again, scarcely believe his son's request.  Incredulously, he says ""Son, I can provide you with all your wildest dreams, anything in this cosmos or the next, all yours but to ask!  And all that your heart desires........ is... a case of pink golf balls?""

Solemnly, the boy answers.  ""Yes Father, I have thought this through and I am certain: 1 case of pink golf balls and I shall be content.""

The Emperor, perplexed again, nevertheless, grants his son's request.  ""So be it.  I shall provide to you.... a case of pink golf ball.""

**Okay, here's where I stop the joke and give you some pointers.  You've got to tell this to drunk people.  They'll be dying to know why the kid wants the pink golf balls, and will want you to continue.  You can stretch out the same setup for each birthday for as long as you can get away with, with each year the son's requests just being more and more outlandish pink-golf ball related things:

A Truck full of pink golf balls
A Warehouse of pink golf balls
A Factory that make nothing but pink golf balls
Finally, a PLANET that is nothing but one giant factory that does nothing but make pink golf balls**

And so, on the occasion of the son's ____ birthday (*however long you've successfully stretched this out), the Supreme Emperor decided to visit his son on the pink-golf-ball-factory-planet he had given him.

On the way to the his son's office, the Emperor's convoy is struck by a speeding pink-golf-ball-carrying truck.  The Emperor is stunned to learn that it was his son driving, coming to meet him, and that his son now lay dying in the wreckage.  He hurries to him.

Stricken, he looks down at his only son.  ""Son, you are dying,"" he chokes out.

""Yes... I know Father,"" the son manages to say.

""Son, I must know, before you pass.  Why?  WHY the pink golf balls?  WHY THE GODDAMN PINK GOLF BALLS?""

So the police get involved and question each actor in order to get to the bottom of this. One actor's demeanor was suspicious to the police and they pushed him hard for answers.

Police: ""Were you the actor who played Aslan?""

Man: ""No!""

Police: ""Then you wouldn't mind submitting blood samples?""

Researchers for the Western Australian Main Roads Department found over 200 dead crows on the Great Northern Highway recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and confirmed that it was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during the analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by trucks, while only 2% were killed by cars. The MRD then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The O.B quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""Truck"".",171,3/18/15-GheeButtersnaps-,Say what you want about deaf people. ||| ,26,3/18/15TheHypnoChode,What happens when people settle for a shitty situation? ||| They're citizens of the So-be-it Union.,5,3/18/15Porjin,Poetry cannot be justified. ||| It's a typography joke.,5,3/18/15pokeanand,"What sound does a Nintendo Ambulence make? ||| Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.",14,3/18/15Battleofcricket,"Define the lecturer ||| Teacher to Student:   Can you define  the lecturer?

While he's thought of divorce, he wouldn't even dare say that word in front of his wife unless he wanted a slow, and painful death.  It seemed there was no way out.  

The only good part of Lou's life is when he gets to see his coworker at his job, named Claire Lee.  She's a bit younger, in her 30's, and never been married.  The two developed a relationship that moved beyond being just coworkers.  Behind Lorraine's back, Lou was having an affair with Claire Lee.  The two were simply in love.  Lou had never felt the kind of affection for Lorraine that he felt for Claire.  He felt terrible thinking it, but he wished and wished for Lorraine to go away.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well.  
The animal cried piteously for hours as   
the farmer tried to figure out what to do. 
Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well, needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. 
He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. 
They all grabbed a shovel and began   
to shovel dirt into the well.  
At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly.  
Then, to everyone's amazement he   
quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well.  
He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing.   
He would shake it off and take a step up. 
As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. 
Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off! 
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt.  
The trick to getting out of the well   
is to shake it off and take a step up. 
Each of our troubles is a steppingstone.  
We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up!  
Shake it off and take a step up. 
Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 
Free your heart from hatred  -  - Forgive. 
Free your mind from worries  -  - Most never happen. 
Live simply and appreciate what you have. 
Give more. Expect less.
NOW ............ 
Enough of that crap  . .   .  The donkey later came back, and bit the  
farmer who had tried to bury him.
The gash from the bite got infected and   
the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.. 

MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON: 
When you do something wrong,  
and try to cover your ass,  
it always comes back to bite you   .

Needless to say he was freaked out by this. Every time he farted, it came out ""hooonda"". He flipped through the phone book and found an American doctor and rushed over. The doctor listened to his bizarre farts, examined him thoroughly then proclaimed he was completely stumped. He sent the salesman to a Japanese doctor that specialized in rare diseases, but this doctor too didn't have a clue. He made an emergency appointment with a gastroenterologist. He too was baffled. On his way out of the last doctor's office, he was panicking. He had to cancel the meeting. How embarrassing would it be if in the middle of the chairman of Toyota's office he let a fart slip and it came out ""hooonda""!  Just before he went out of the office door, the receptionist called after him. ""The doctor recommends you try going to a dentist."" ""A dentist?"", he thought. What the heck. He was desperate at this point so he called a local dentist. When he arrived and described his problem to the old Japanese dentist, the dentist nodded his head and said ""you have abscessed tooth.""

It was getting very late, so the man decided to scout the area on foot. He gets his flashlight and starts walking. He finds a  monastery nearby.  He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"". The monks at the monastery generously accept him, feed him dinner, and they give him a place to sleep. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. He couldn't tell what the sound was, it was both disturbing yet soothing, dark but innocent, malicious yet amazing, cold and creepy yet warm and welcoming. The man was bewildered by the sweet but yet somehow frightening sound. The next morning, he asks the monks about the sound, but they say ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way...

Some years later, the same man was again driving down the same road and again his car breaks down in front of the same monastery.  The monks again accept him, feed him. Again that night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard all those years earlier, and it was as enchanting as he had heard it all those years ago. The next morning, he asks the monks about the sound, but the monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man frustrated says, all right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is by becoming  a monk, then I will, tell me, how do I become a monk? The monks look at each other whisper something among themselves and reply, you must travel to an Island and live there for about 10 years, you must learn about the meaning of life, and when you do, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, I have traveled the earth and found what you have asked me. The monk who was the oldest and the wisest asks ""what is the meaning of life? The man walks up to the monk and whispers two words in his ear. The monk smiles and replies  ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound"". The monks lead the man to a wooden door. The old monk says,""The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says ,""Real funny, may I have the key?"".The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door was another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key,  and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, and this went on and on until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, amethyst and a whole lot moreâ€_ 

Finally, they reach a large door made of an unknown white substance, the monks say, ""This is the last door"". The man is relieved to know that he had reached the endâ€_ 




He unlocks the doorâ€_   







turns the knob...






and behind that door he is amazed to findâ€_

The bartender is just closing up when he sees the group approach his door. The rabbi goes first and knocks on the door.
Rabbi: ""Knock Knock""
Bartender: ""Who's there?""
Rabbi: ""I'm Jewish""
Bartender: ""Jewish who?""
Rabbi: ""D'you wish to buy this chicken crossing the road, I can give you a good price for it?""
The bartender looks at the chicken.
Bartender: ""That's not your chicken, he's a regular here. Hey chicken, what do you think of this rabbi?""
The chicken looks the rabbi up and down.
Chicken: ""Cheep cheep!""
Bartender: ""You're right, this guy is cheap, get out of here!""
And so the rabbi is sent off and the atheist approaches the door.
Atheist: ""Knock Knock""
Bartender: ""Who's th-""
Atheist: ""Well I'm an atheist and I'd just like to point out that you're all wrong. That's not a chicken, it's quite obviously a rooster. It's quite obvious.""
Bartender: ""Oh, well ""rooster"" what do you think of this guy?""
Again the rooster looks the atheist up and down.
Rooster: ""Cock-a-doodle doo!""
Bartender: ""You're right this guy is a cock, and a ""doodle"" too I suppose. Get out of here!""
So the atheist is sent off to post angry comments on a forum as the priest approaches the door.
Priest: ""Knock Knock""
Bartender: ""Who's there?""
Priest: ""I'm a priest""
Bartender: ""Oh an Irishman!""
Priest: ""No no I'm not Irish""
Bartender: ""Oh well what business do you have here then?""
Priest: ""Well I heard there was some little cock around here checking out the religious men outside this bar?""
The bartender, disgusted, sends the priest away and invites the rooster into his bar after all the trouble. They sit down and the bartender turns to the rooster. Confused as to why the chicken never told the bartender he was a rooster, he turns to the rooster.
Bartender: ""So rooster, why the long farce?""

He is surprised when she says yes, and they decide to go out that Saturday. So the young man goes home, and spends the remainder of the week agonizing over what to do on their date. Should they go to dinner? A movie? Roller skating? Skydiving? Maybe go on a big game hunt? He has no idea. Finally Saturday comes, and as he is driving over to pick her up, he notices a sign saying that the Big Top is in town. He immediately knows thatâ€™s where they need to go. 

So he picks up his date, radiant as ever, and they head to the Circus. Sheâ€™s incredibly excited, as she hasnâ€™t been since she was a child. They buy cotton candy, popcorn, peanuts, big drinks, and make their way to the front row, where he managed to get tickets. The two watch in amazement as the dancing horses come out, followed by bears balancing on large rubber balls, then the elephants. They watch in trepidation as the lion tamer whips and yells at the lion, as the trapeze artists fly to and fro. They watch delightedly as finally the clowns make their way to the center of the ring. They bound about acrobatically, juggle while riding the unicycle, and joke with the crowd. The head clown notices the young man in the front row with the beautiful girl, and comes strolling over.

As he motions for the attention of the crowd, he leans toward the young man and says:

â€œHey mister, are you the horseâ€™s head?â€ù

And the young man replies â€œWellâ€_noâ€ù

So the head clown says, â€œWell that must make you the horseâ€™s ass!â€ù
The whole tent erupts with laughter at the young man, who is absolutely humiliated. Even his date is laughing. He tries to hide his anger, and pretends it doesnâ€™t bother him. But he spends the rest of the evening fuming over the joke. He barely even notices that his date kisses him good night when he drops her off. 

That night, the young man is unable to sleep. Lying in bed, he can think of nothing other than the clown. Why didnâ€™t he say something? Why didnâ€™t he stand up for himself? He has no answers, and finally falls asleep, dreaming of destroying the clown.

The next morning, the young man wakes up with a deep sense of purpose. Never in his life has he felt such drive. He will dedicate his life to getting back at the clown. He heads out the door, and immediately enrolls in university, majoring in Comebackology.

The young man gives his classes everything heâ€™s got. He quickly rises to the top of his class, a star pupil. He wows his professors during finals, and is even crowned Valedictorian upon graduation, receiving his Bachelor of Science in Comebackology.

But he doesnâ€™t feel ready. So he redoubles his efforts, and goes back to school, continuing to impress the faculty. After an amazingly quick year, he is awarded his Masterâ€™s Degree in Comebackology, the fastest it has ever been awarded. But still, he believes that he needs to become the greatest Comeback master who ever lived before he gets his revenge. So he continues his education, writing his PhD thesis on the â€œAmbiguities of the modern riposte: Is brevity still the soul of wit?â€ù His professors are dumbfounded by the brilliance of the paper. He is lauded throughout the country as one of the preeminent Comebackologists, even asked to be on talk shows. The fame is staggering.

But the boy, now a man, doesnâ€™t feel as though he is ready. He still seethes inside at the humiliation the clown dealt him. Nothing but the absolute verbal destruction of the clown will pacify him.

So he leaves the country, and begins studying with old Comeback masters around the world. But at each and every stop, he finds that he has surpassed them all. They have nothing left to teach him. But there are rumors of the greatest Comeback master alive, hidden away in the mountains of Nepal. For years the man searches him out, following clues and half remembered stories. His perseverance pays off, however, and he finds himself, exhausted and nearly dead, at the entrance to a great wooden temple built into a mountain. He is welcomed inside by the master himself, who had known that this day would come. The master is elated that a student worthy of his teachings has finally found him. The two become fast friends, working together day and night, meditating on the most ethereal of comebacks, the God Comebacks. 15 years the man spends there, until finally the master dies, happily bequeathing his title to his only pupil. The man takes one final look at his old master, then squaring his shoulders, heads out the door and down the mountain. He is finally ready.

The man goes back home, welcomed by family and friends, who had long believed him dead. He calls up the same young lady he had taken out all those years before, and incredibly, she is still single, and willing to go out again. 

So he picks up his date, radiant as ever, and they head to the Circus. Sheâ€™s incredibly excited, as she hasnâ€™t been since her first date with the man. They buy cotton candy, popcorn, peanuts, big drinks, and make their way to the front row, where he again managed to get tickets. The two watch in amazement as the dancing horses come out, followed by bears balancing on large rubber balls, then the elephants. They watch in trepidation as the lion tamer whips and yells at the lion, as the trapeze artists fly to and fro. They watch delightedly as finally the clowns make their way to the center of the ring. They bound about acrobatically, juggle while riding the unicycle, and joke with the crowd. The head clown, still the same man, after all of these years, recognizes the man in the front row with the beautiful girl, and comes strolling over.

As he motions for the attention of the crowd, he leans toward the young man and says:

â€œHey mister, are you the horseâ€™s head?â€ù

And the young man replies â€œWellâ€_noâ€ù

So the head clown says, â€œWell that must make you the horseâ€™s ass!â€ù

The whole tent erupts with laughter at the man. Even his date is laughing. But he is unruffled. He stands up, looks at the clown, waits for the laughter to die down and says:

A storm blows and forces them down a tributary they had not planned on and they find themselves washed ashore in the territory of a very secretive tribe. 
The chieftan comes down to the shore and regretfully informs the trio that, having seen what comes to tribes that allow the outside world to know of their existence,  the trio must die. However because the tribe subscribes to the waste not want not philosophy,  the chieftan tells the trio that their deaths will not be in vain. Their bodies will be used. The meat will feed the tribe and their skin will line the canoes so the tribe may fish. 

The chieftan asks which of the trio is willing to go first and because he's not an ass he is willing to grant them all a final wish, and to decide on the order of the it demise.

The priest offers to go first and requests a moment of prayer before he is killed.  The chieftan obliges and the priest goes off to say a rosary. When he returns he is killed, skinned, put in a stew and the tribe's tanners set to work on prepping his skin for lining the canoes.

The Irishman is next and asks for a pint of their strongest liquor. The chief obliges and the Irishman meets the same fate as the priest.

Finally the New Yorker is up and he asks for a fork. Confused, the chieftan asks the New Yorker what a fork is since the tribe has no idea what a fork is.  The New Yorker draws a fork in the sand and the chieftan instructs his men to make the man a fork.  All are very confused.

When the fork is completed the chieftan hands the New Yorker the fork and asks why the man wants that for, of all things,  his last request on this earth.

The New Yorker smiles,  grasps the fork by the handles and aims the tines toward his chest and violently stabs him self over and over again in the chest shouting,  ""This is what I think of your fucking canoe!""",0,3/20/15promyth3us,"What did the Banana say to the Monkey? ||| Yo

Although if that second person who believes themselves not to be a feminist is helping a feminist to change the lightbulb, then to some extent that second person believes in the ability of women to do jobs which, at one point in time, were reserved exclusively for men.

When he got home, the dog looked hungry, so he made a steak just for the dog, and turned on the television.

When he got on the plane, he found that he couldn't take the dog without preparations; the airline, however, was willing to transfer his ticket for a nominal fee. He was forced to pay this fee, and the veterinarian's bills, with a credit card, which irked him even though he knew the reward would offset it. 

Then he flew to the city in question, but since he was only twenty-four, had to walk ten miles through the woods, going in the general direction of the manor.

A while later the rabbi spoke up and asked, ""Father, is it still a
requirement of your church that you remain celibate?""
 
The priest replied, ""Yes, that is still very much a part of our faith.""
 
The rabbi then asked him, ""Father, have you ever fallen to the temptations
of the flesh?""
 
The priest replied, ""Yes, Rabbi, on one occasion I was weak and broke the
pledge of my faith.""
 
The rabbi then nodded understandingly and remained silent for several

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully.

He got down on one knee, inspected the elephant's foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenage son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring intently at him.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same elephant.",7,3/22/15Midgetbullfighter,"A Man Named Yuri ||| There once was a man named Yuri.

Yuri had lived in Russia all of his life, in a small town near Moscow. The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, ""SWIMMING LESSONS"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.

Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, ""If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough..."" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money.  Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri's.

A few months had passed, and Yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived. 

Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""DIVING PRACTICES"" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.

Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""It is only something I am fond of, a hobby"" Yuri would say. ""I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy."" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!"" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.

Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" Yuri would always respond to his fans.

One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!"" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, ""And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" Yuri replied, ""Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.""

Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.

Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. ""Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!"" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""It is OK, everybody"" Yuri yelled back.

""It's just Banana juice"", replies the farmer innocently.

""I don't believe you"", says the policeman, and grabs the flask from the farmer. He takes a huge swig, and grimaces at what he's just swallowed. ""Urgh! That's disgusting!""

""It's just Banana juice"", repeats the farmer.

His parents were both musicians, so Little Billy started playing the organ when he was 5. He practiced and practiced after school every day until it was very late. He loved the organ very much. He even got private lessons from a professional organist from his local church. His mother, while supporting his hobby, was warned by his pediatrician: â€œBilly practicing on the organ has prevented him from spending any time outside. It seems as if he is not receiving the appropriate amount of exercise recommended at his age.â€ù His mother ignored his doctor for years, assured that Billyâ€™s hobby was perfectly safe. Billy did not have many friends due to his obsession with the organ. He didnâ€™t care; he loved the organ. He performed his own composition at a local church and received a standing ovation. There he met the love of his life at this church, and they started dating. However, they promptly broke up when she couldnâ€™t support his obsession with the organ, calling his lifestyle too â€œorganic.â€ù When Billy grew to be 15 years old, he heard of this orchestra from his town that needed an organist, but it was really hard to get accepted into. This only made Billy want to practice and practice more. Finally, the day for his audition came. He went to the audition room and started to play, but no sound would come out of the organ. The organ was broken. The judge, a middle aged man named Mr. Harley, immediately arranged for Billy to play on another organ. As Billy began to play, the organ also creaked and then ceased to make a sound. Mr. Harley arranged for yet another organ for Billy, but that one broke down as well. Before Mr. Harley could ask for one more organ, he suddenly collapsed to the ground. Later, at the hospital, the doctors pronounced Mr. Harley dead and performed an autopsy. ""The cause of death appears to be multiple organ failure.""

So he took his costume and away he went.

The wife, after sleeping soundly for about an hour, woke without pain and as it was still early decided go to the party. As her husband didn't know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.

So she joined the party and soon spotted her husband in his costume, cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice ""chick"" he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there.

His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his new partner high and dry and devoted his time to her. She let him go as far as he wished, naturally, since he was her husband.
