course_you_do,"The Sportsman's Double ||| I met an older woman at a bar last night. She looked pretty good for a 60-year-old. In fact, she wasn't too bad at all, and I found myself thinking she probably had a really hot daughter.

We drank a couple of beers, and she asked if I'd ever had a Sportsman's Double? 'What's that? I asked. 'It's a mother and daughter threesome,' she said. 

As my mind began to embrace the idea, and I wondered what her daughter might look like, I said, 'No, I haven't.'

We drank a bit more, then she said with a wink, 'tonight's your lucky night'. 

We went back to her place. We walked in. She put on the hall light and shouted upstairs: 'Mom, you still awake?'",1158,2015-01-01

NASA and reasonable science enthusiasts has for decades been begging the capital hill for an increase in funds to do what they need to be able to do, and capital hill replied for decades ""We'll think about it."" Now it has happened at an unexpected rate. An earlier agreement that capital hill head among both parties was to fund various projects towards the development of the ""international space station"" for what is said to be for both scientific and diplomatic reasons.


When asking the two party representitives the following statements were made. The democratic party stated ""we hope that we can find a way to create a habitat planet for the humpback whales since the world will be uninhabitable by any living thing throughout the entire history of time since that one guy won't stop smoking, despite it adding calories when he does."" 
The conservative represented had this to say. ""We really hope that this new deal would be able to bring about diplomatic relations with the world's hippies and deadbeats for future lsnd, i mean money, I mean voters... favors? Yes favors, let's go with that."" When the president was asked about why he didn't veto the bill he said ""I understand how this is a huge concern among my fans er American people, and want to better reflect how I the popular, er president would be willing to accommodate. Perhaps we can use this to move towards a brighter future of political conduct such as how long, er any given president should be in term. Further.. huuuh... what does the prompter say it turned off. Oh there it goes. Further we want to make sure that everyone is as happy as they can be with our policies.


Certain items pertaining to the project funds were specified to be used including but not limited to: 
*moon dust converting to water
*targeting systems with several tetrameters of reach with accuracy
*moon dust converting to ""what whales breath if not water""
*machines to monitor money transactions on a global scale
*moon dust converting to ""what whales eat if not water""
*machines to scan people's voting records on a global scale to determine statistics and effect voting fraud.
and many more.

It's about time government realized that the NASA program needed to have a better budget, and I as I non inspecting reporter feel perfectly fine with the potential changes that can occur.

His first wish is for unlimited food & drink. The spirit grants it and he is able to find food whenever he needs it.
His second wish is to be able to hear music whenever he wants. The spirit agrees and the air is filled with the sounds of whatever song the man wants to hear.
His third wish is for Angelina Jolie to be stranded on the island with him. The spirit grants his last wish and Angelina appears.

He gets to know Angelina well over the next few weeks and months. They eat and drink well, and listen to the most beautiful music day and night, in between session after session of the most amazing sex.

After a few weeks he begins to become depressed. Angelina tries her best to get to the cause of it but they can't figure it out. One night after roasting a pig on a spit, he turns to her and asks if he can try something. She agrees, so he dips his finger into the charcoal and draws a mustache on her. She is baffled but doesn't stop him. Then he draws a beard. She is thoroughly confused at this stage.

Well, two days ago I was out for an evening with friends and had several cocktails followed by some rather nice red wine.  Feeling jolly I still had the sense to know that I may be slightly over the limit.  That's when I did something that I've never done before - I took a cab home.  Sure enough on the way home there was a police road block, but since it was a cab they waved it past.  I arrived home safely without incident.

kokain711,"A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.... ||| A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""

So next Sunday he took the monsignors advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door: 

1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. 
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. 
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. 
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. 
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. 
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C. 
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook. 
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. 
9. When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass. 
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T"" 
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me.""

skeanthu,"Norwegian Volunteer Fire Dept ||| One dark night outside a small town in Minnesota, a fire started inside the local chemical plant and in a blink of an eye it exploded into massive flames. The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.
 
When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.""
 
But the roaring flames held the firefighters off.
 
Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department who could bring out the company's secret files.
 
From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant.
 
Without even slowing down it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire fought it back on all sides.  It was a performance and effort never seen before.
 
Within a short time, the Norske old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.
 
The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?"" 
 
""Vell,"" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, ""Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!",184,2015-01-02

He thinks it's a little odd, but shrugs it off and continues working. A few days later, the voice returns. ""Sell everything you have and move to Las Vegas.""

He shrugs it off again, but it continues to come back. Over the next few weeks, he hears the voice more often, always saying the same thing - ""Sell everything you have and move to Las Vegas.""

""I can't just sell everything I have and move"" he thinks to himself.

""Sell everything you have and move to Las Vegas.""

""I just can't up and move from--""

""Sell everything you have and move to Las Vegas.""

The man becomes frustrated. The next few days at work, the voice is relentless.

Finally, the man gives in. He sells his home, cars, and every personal belonging he has until he's left with nothing but a big bank account. He drives the one car he didn't sell to Las Vegas. As he's approaching the city, the voice returns.

""Go to the Bellagio.""

The man drives to the Bellagio. As he parks, the voice says ""Take your cash and go to the roulette table.""

""What? This is everything I have, I'm not betting it all on--""

""Bet everything you have on the number 26""

The man breathes deep. He sets all of his chips on the number 26. Everyone at the table gives him a strange look as the dealer spins the wheel and puts the ball in. The wheel spins and the ball begins to bounce around inside the wheel. The wheel slows and the ball settles into the number 8.

So, the bartender takes down a 15 year single malt Scotch, pours it out, and gives it to the customer. He takes a sip, correctly identifying the age, and returns it to the bartender, asking again for a 20 year old single malt Scotch. The bartender pours again, concealing the label from the customer, and, after taking a sip, the customer smiles and declares his drink a proper 20 year old single malt Scotch. And, in amazement, the bartender takes his hand from the bottle, and verifies that it is indeed what the customer ordered. One of the three drunks from the other end of the bar walks down with a glass, and asks the Scotch specialist to taste test it. He raises the glass to his lips, takes a sip and sprays it all over the bar, exclaiming ""This is piss!!!""  ""Yes ""says the drunk, ""but how old am I?""

“Hey, there, young fella. Whatcha doin’ walking around this neck of the woods this early in the morning?”

The young man holds up a roll of duct tape and calls back, “I’m going to catch some ducks!”

The older man just shakes his head at the foolishness of the young one, as he watches him stroll along into the woods. A few hours later, however, he shakes his head in wonderment as he sees the young man emerge from the woods, dragging a trail of ducks that have been caught in the tape. The young man smiles and waves as he walks by.

About a week later, the scene replays itself, except this other morning, the young man is carrying something larger. The older man calls out again, “Hey there, young fella, where are you off to today?”

This time, the young man holds up a roll of chicken wire and shouts, “I’m gonna catch me some chickens!”

Once again, the old codger shakes his head as he watches the younger man stroll into the woods. And, once again, he is shocked to see the kid walk back out of the woods a few hours later, dragging along a trail of chickens that have been caught in the wire.

Don't ask why, you just are, and your Sergeant hates you) walking on a deserted street late at night.
Suddenly, an armed man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife and lunges at you.
You are carrying your truncheon and are an expert in using it.  However, you have only a split second to react before he reaches you.  What do you do?

ANSWER:

English  Police  Officer:

Firstly, the Officer must consider the man's human rights.

1) Does the man look poor or oppressed?

2) Has he newly arrived in this country and does not yet understand the law?

3) Is this really a knife or a ceremonial dagger?

4) Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?

5) Am I dressed provocatively?

6) Could I run away?

7) Could I possibly swing my truncheon and knock the knife out of his hand?

8) Should I try and negotiate with him to discuss his wrong-doings?

9)  Why am I carrying a truncheon anyway and what kind of message does this send to society?

10) Does he definitely want to kill me or would he be content just to wound me?

11) If I were to grab his knees and hold on, would he still want to stab and kill me?

12) If I raise my truncheon and he turns and runs away, do I get blamed if he falls over, knocks his head and kills himself?  

13) If I hurt him and lose the subsequent court case, does he have the opportunity to sue me, cost me my  job, my credibility and the loss of my family home?

A zoo's gorilla dies right before the zoo opens. It is the only gorilla at the zoo since they are not very profitable. However, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they cannot afford to go without it. So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.
Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla. In about a month, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. 
A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and horror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lions den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!"" Suddenly a lion pounces him from behind and whispers in his ear, ""Shut the fuck up right now or you're going to get us both fired.""",83,2015-01-03

I was in complete shock. I still liked this girl, and he clearly had no class, but my hands were tied. But there was a group of people I knew who really didn't like him. So I said, “Fuck it.

They have eight hours of sex after their marriage. She wakes up at 10 o’clock, he’s gone but there’s a note on her pillow. 
It says -:
“My darling Harriet.
To think that I waited a year to consummate our loving relationship makes my heart beat so loudly I’m surprised it didn’t wake you up.
The only reason I’m not here now darling is that I’m at work to make enough money to buy you a house, a picket fence, we’ll have dogs and children.

When the 5 o’clock dinner bell rings I will be home like the winged Gossamer of love in your arms.

Your loving husband, Harry.

Before they reached the destination, the terrorist's plot was discovered. However, he was able to throw the apple, the orange, and the bomb out of the plane's door.
On the ground, a police officer was on patrol in the middle of a small town when he saw a little girl crying alongside the road. ""Little girl, are you okay?"" The little girl, fighting back tears, said, ""I was just walking when all of a sudden an apple fell from the sky and hit me on the head!"" This puzzled the police officer, as no apples grew in this part of the state. The officer continued his patrol, until he saw another girl crying hysterically. The police officer questioned this child as well. ""I was walking my dog and an orange hit me. Where'd it come from!?"" ""This is very odd"", thought the officer.
After a few short minutes, the police officer came upon another child along the road, however, this young boy was laughing hysterically. ""Why are you laughing so hard? Did fruit fall on you too?"" The little boy replied, ""No, officer!"" ""Daddy farted and the house blew up!""",1,2015-01-03

Suddenly, the Prime Minister of Canada walks up to them with a huge smile on his face and says, ""Hey Dave! Long time no see!"" Mike is in shock and just listens to Dave and the PM chat, laugh and act lie they're old friends. After a bit, the PM says goodbye and walks off.

""You know the Prime Minister!?"" Mike asks. ""Of course,"" says Dave, ""We've been friends for forever."" So Mike asks him questions about it, like where they met, how they met, etc. While Mike is questioning Dave, lo and behold, the President of the United States walks up to them. ""Dave! Holy moley! How you've been, man? Great to see you! When you coming by the White House again?"" Mike's jaw drops. Once again, he listens to the POTUS and Dave chat and laugh. POTUS fist pounds Dave, says goodbye, and walks off.

""You know the President!?"" Mike asks in total disbelief. ""Of course,"" Dave answers, ""I never told you that?"" So of course, Mike starts questioning Dave about it. How did they meet, where, when, etc. Suddenly, Dave apologizes and says, ""Mike, it's been good hanging out and everything but I gotta run. I've been invited by the pope to go hang out in the Vatican."" Mike is understandably confused and doubtful.

""Ok, I can accept that you know both the president and the PM, but there's no way you know the Pope. That's impossible,"" Mike says. ""It's true. We're old friends. In fact, I'll prove it. I'm allowed to bring a friend to Italy with me. Come along and I'll show you.""

So Mike and Dave head over to Vatican City and Dave tells Mike to wait in the crowd in St. Peter's Square while the Pope does the Angelus prayer, the prayer he does every sunday at noon from his balcony. So Mike waits and keeps checking his watch, but begins to wonder where Dave went. Suddenly, chimes start ringing. 12 rings later, it's noon, and out steps the Pope, and would you believe that, to his side, is Dave! Mike nearly faints. The crowd is going crazy. Suddenly, a stranger grabs Mike, and says, ""Oh Jesus. I can't believe it! It''s really him! But, who's that guy standing next to Dave?""",11,2015-01-03

The three guys look at each other and wonder how hard that could be. They all agreed and the gates opened. The buddies look out and see the whole place is just swarming with ducks. They took some steps in making sure they don't step on any ducks. A few days pass when BAM the first guy steps on a duck. God soon appears with the most ugliest women the guy had ever seen. God says ""Because you stepped on a duck you will now be chained to the ugliest woman in heaven for the rest of your time here."" God snaps his finger and the first guy and woman, chained together, vanish. The other two buddies make a pact to look out for each other to make sure they don't suffer the same fate.

Years go by and the two buddies have been incredibly careful. They watched wherever they stepped. However, one morning one of the buddies steps out of bed...right onto a duck. BAM, God appears with the most wretched, horse faced, mole bearing woman the two buddies had ever seen. God snapped his fingers and they both vanished.

Finally, the last buddy who had been careful for years is the only one left. He continues walking around his duck filled palace being incredibly careful. Decades go by and he is still hanging in there when suddenly BAM God appears. 

""But, I never stepped on a duck,"" the young man stammered.

God doesn't say anything, but snaps his fingers. Soon the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen appeared by his side. God left without ever speaking a word.

The man asked the woman what happened.

Slightly dazed the turtle gets up and starts climbing the tree again. This time the turtle passes the first branch, and starts crawling along a higher, less sturdy branch. Once again he reaches the end, hesitates, and then jumps off flailing wildly and end over end until he smashes head first into the ground.

This time the turtle seems clearly shaken up, but resolutely starts climbing the tree again. He bypasses both the first and second branch and climbs out the highest, most shaky branch. This time when he reaches the end of the branch he looks over and waves at two birds watching him.

Their resort happened to be clothing optional and so wanting to fit it, the man went to the bar for a drink sans clothes.  He noticed the bartender, who was nude, also happened to have ""Wy"" tattooed on his penis.  Getting excited, he asked the bartender whether he also had a girlfriend named Wendy and if he had her name tattooed on his penis.  The bartender looked up at the guy, smiling, and said no he didn't have a girlfriend named Wendy.  The guy asked what his tattoo read then.  The bartender, still smiling, replied, ""Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day""",56,2015-01-04

A telemarketer calls a house and a little girl answers the phone:

Little girl (LG): \*quiet voice* *""Hello?""*

Telemarketer (TM) ""Hello there and good day, would you mother be available to talk to?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""No, she's busy at the moment.*""

TM: ""Oh, okay, would your father be there at all?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""No, he's busy at the moment as well.""*

TM: ""Right, is there someone else over the age of 18 there?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""There's my uncle...""*

TM: ""Oh? Can I speak to your uncle please?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""No, he's busy at the moment.*

TM: ""Well then, who else is there right now?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""My aunt is here too.""*

TM: ""Great, can you put your aunt on the phone then?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""I'm sorry, she's busy at the moment.""*

TM: ""Well then, who else is in the house?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""There's our next door neighbour""*

TM: Right, I'll have a chat to him if you don't mind?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""He's busy right now too.""*

The telemarketer is starting to get a little frustrated, he's had a shit day, hasn't made any sales, and he's keen to get get one on the board before he goes home, so he asks the little girl:

TM: ""Are the any other adults there?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""There's a policeman, a fireman, and there's a priest""*

Unable to contain it any longer, the telemarketer's curiosity and frustration get the better of him:

TM: ""What the *hell* are all those people doing at your house, and why are they all too busy to talk to me right now!?

So he calls the vet, and the vet examines it. He picks a piece of straw off the ground, sticks one end in the horse's arse and blows on the other end. The horse returns to normal.

The next day, the same thing happens, so the man calls the vet again. Like before, the vet picks up a piece of straw, sticks one end in the horse's arse and blows with all his might. Like before, the horse returns to normal.

On the third day, the same thing happens yet again. This time, the owner thinks ""I think I've got it"" and takes a piece of straw off the ground, sticks it in the horse's arse and blows with all his might, yet it doesn't work.

 ""Have you been in the Far East recently, within the last year or so?"" ""Why, yes,"" replied the man. 
""And did you have sex while over there?"" 
The man looked worried. ""Well, yes, once or twice.""

The man gulped. ""What do you do for it? Is there a cure?""
 ""Well, sort of. You see, there is no way to cure the disease, but you must have an operation.""
 ""An operation? What kind of operation?"" ""We cut off your penis."" ""Wow! Do you mind if I get a second opinion?"" 
The doctor replied, ""Of course not. In something of such a serious nature as this, I think you should get a second and a third opinion!"" The man consulted a urologist who told him essentially the same story, diagnosis, prognosis, and recommended treatment. He was understandably upset, so he asked the second doctor to recommend another doctor for his third opinion. The urologist suggested that, since this disease originated in the Far East that he travel there, as the Asian doctors might know more about it. Mr. Unlucky promptly booked passage on an airline for Hong Kong, where he received an immediate consultation with that Crown Colony's most eminent physician. After a series of tests, he awaited the verdict. The doctor entered the examining room.
 ""Well, is it Hong Kong Dong?"" he inquired, unable to wait.
 ""Yes.""
 ""And is it really incurable?""
 ""Yes, there is no known cure."" 
The man's face crumpled as he fought back tears. ""And am I going to have an operation? Will they have to cut off my penis?"" 
At that the man was astonished to see the doctor break into laughter. ""What's so funny, Doc? You mean I don't have to have surgery?"" 
As the doctor regained control of himself, he managed to choke out, ""Oh, those American doctors! Cut, clamp, sew! Surgery, surgery, all they can think of is surgery!""

Gin_chan,"Headache ||| A man went to the doctor suffering from severe headaches. After a thorough examination, the doctor turned to him and said: ""Jerry, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration.""

""You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates these serious headaches you've been experiencing. So the only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" 

Jerry was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. 

When he eventually left the hospital Jerry was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt not to have a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he also knew that he was missing an important part of himself. 

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a fresh start and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and thought to himself a new suit would be the perfect thing to mark this new beginning. 

He entered the shop and told the salesman: ""I'd like a new suit."" 
The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said: ""Let's see... size 44 long?"" 
""That's right, how did you know?"" said Jerry, laughing. 

""I've been in the business 60 years!"" replied the tailor. 

Jerry tried on the suit and it fitted like a glove. As Jerry admired himself in the mirror, the salesman 
asked: ""How about a new shirt?"" 

Jerry thought for a moment and then agreed. 
The salesman eyed Jerry again. 

""Let's see... 34 sleeve and 16-and-a-half neck?"" 

Once again, Jerry was surprised. 
""That's right, how did you know?"" 

""Like I said, I've been in the business 60 years!"" 

So Jerry tried on the shirt, and it was a perfect fit. As Jerry adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked: ""How about new shoes?"" Jerry was on a roll and so thought, why not? 
So the salesman eyed Jerry's feet and said: ""Let's see... you must be a size nine-and-a-half?"" 

Jerry was astonished. ""That's right, how did you know?"" 
""Well, young fella, I've been in the business long enough to know these things!"" 

Jerry tried on the shoes and they were also a remarkable fit. Jerry walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked: ""So that only leaves the new underwear. How about it?"" 

Jerry thought for a second and agreed. 
The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said: ""Let's see... size 36."" 

Jerry laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" 
The salesman shook his head. ""There's no way. I'm never wrong. You can't wear a size 34."" 

""Oh yes I can,"" replied Jerry and have been most of my life. 
""I don't understand,"" said the tailor. ""By my reckoning a 34 underwear would press your testicles up 
against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.""",306,2015-01-04

One day a guy was mowing his lawn. He was about a 6, so let's call him that. 6 was mowing his lawn until a dog came running down the street. 6 chased the dog until he caught him. He turned around and saw that a beautiful girl had been chasing the dog too. She was a 9, so lets call her 9. 9 thanked 6 for getting her dog. 6 asked for her number. His palms sweat while 9 made her decision. Success!

6 and 9 started going on dates. Before they knew it, they were in a relationship.

Fast forward a little bit, and in enters 7. 7 is another girl that 6 meets, and she is a 7, so that's why we will call her 7.

6 and 7 start hanging out. 6 thinks that they are just friends, but 7 is romantically interested. One day, 6 introduces 9 to 7. 7 gets extremely jealous and starts being very passive aggressive to 9.

A couple weeks later, 9 tells 6 that 7 had been sending her death threats over FaceBook. She asked 6 to make her stop, and 6 did send her messages over FB, asking her to stop, but 7 didn't reply.

4 weeks later, 6 hasn't heard from either 9 nor 7 over facebook, and he starts to get worried. He is pacing the floor when suddenly, a knock comes at the door. He opens it and waiting for him is a police officer. Officer holds up a picture of 9 and asks, ""Is this your girlfriend?""

""Yes,"" 6 replies. His palms start to get sweaty, sweaty like they did a month or two ago when he asked for 9's number, but it didn't feel the same.

The officer proceeds to say that 7 had committed suicide in her room an that they found remains of 9 in her stomach during the autopsy.

A family of four was attending the buffet after a Sunday service, when re-animation occurred suddenly and with extreme lethality. The mother sat down with some Mongolian beef on her plate, and started to gorge, when the beef attacked. According to eye witnesses, it happened so quickly the poor woman didn’t have a fighting chance. Multiples pieces of Mongolian beef lunged at the woman, knocking her off her chair. She tried to get up but the beef was to strong. Her husband and some other bystanders tried to knock the beef off of her, but it was to quick and evaded them. The husband was only able to grab a single piece of beef and smash it with a plate, before zombie beef still in serving trays, started to re-animate. Then the shock and awe turned into complete pandemonium. The Mongolian beef swarmed out of the serving trays and started wriggling their way towards the already incapacitated lady. Some beef pieces grabbed plastic knifes as they left the buffet area, and when they reached the woman, they started sawing off the woman’s feet. But that wasn't the cause of death the autopsy report says. The cause of death was asphyxiation. Over seventy five pieces of Mongolian beef had forced their way down the woman's throat. The pictures I saw on TMZ, were pretty funny though.

According to eye witnesses, it happened so quickly the poor woman didn’t have a fighting chance. Multiples pieces of Mongolian beef lunged at the woman, knocking her off her chair. She tried to get up but the beef was to strong. Her husband and some other bystanders tried to knock the beef off of her, but it was to quick and evaded them. The husband was only able to grab a single piece of beef and smash it with a plate, before zombie beef still in serving trays, started to re-animate. Then the shock and awe turned into complete pandemonium. The Mongolian beef swarmed out of the serving trays and started wriggling their way towards the already incapacitated lady. Some beef pieces grabbed plastic knifes as they left the buffet area, and when they reached the woman, they started sawing off the woman’s feet. But that wasn't the cause of death the autopsy report says. The cause of death was asphyxiation. Over seventy five pieces of Mongolian beef had forced their way down the woman's throat. The pictures I saw on TMZ, were pretty funny though.""

The secound one looks a bit worried due to how good the other poets poem was.

""Jerry, something really strange happened to me at the track the other day""    
""What happened Bill?""    
""Well, I was running a race and I was stuck in the middle of the pack trying to break away. I thought I would lose that race but then I saw a strange light flash from the stands.

""Holy Shit"", said Jerry.     
""Bill, thats exactly what happened to me only a few days ago. I was running a race and about half way, I started to drop back. I thought I was going to lose for sure but then I saw that strange light coming from the stands.

""Excuse me lads,"" said the Race Dog. ""I couldn't help but over hear your conversation and I wanted to let you know that that very same thing happened to me about a week ago down at the track. I was running a race and struggling on the outside lane trying to get some space when I started to drift further back and away from the lead. I knew I was going to lose that race but then that very strange light that you boys had just described started pulsing from the stands.

- No! Every time I drink with you I wake up all beat up and sore. You get way too aggressive when you drink.
- Come on! I won't touch you this time, I swear.

After some more convincing rabbit agrees and they drink all night. The next morning rabbit wakes up without an ear and with broken nose.

- Bear! You asshole! You swore you won't hit me.
- When you puked all over my carpet, I held myself back. When you tried to have sex with my wife, I held myself back.

So the man gets comfortable and sips his cocktail. And by and by he becomes peckish, and asks the bartender for a bite to eat. All the bartender can offer him is pork rinds, so that’ll have to do. So the man chomps down on those salty, crunchy pork rinds. And he likes them. In fact, he likes them so much that he gets a pork rind lodged in his throat.

And the hillbilly reaches around the man’s waist, unbuckles his belt, drops his breeches, yanks down his briefs, and sticks his tongue up his ass crack. The man is so shocked that he has a violent spasm, which causes the pork rind to fly out of his mouth. As he begins to breathe again, he struggles to express his gratitude to the good Samaritan.

allenflame,"New Farmer ||| A City slicker decided after working at a desk job in the cities for 30 years that he wanted to retire to the country and have a hobby farm.

He bought a nice 10 acre hobby farm, moved his family and possetions into the house and was very pleased. Now he needed to get some farm animals.

He was new to this, so he decided to walk down the long gravel road to visit his neihbors who were all farmers and see if he could purchas a few animals to get him started.

He came to the first farm on his left, walked up the dirt driveway and greeted the farmer. He told him he wanted to buy a rabbit. The farmer looked at hime and replied ""Around here we don't call them rabbits, we call them Peter cotton tails"" or you can just call them a ""Peter"" for short.

He thanked him for letting him know and then said he wanted to buy a Peter if the farmer had one he could sell him. The farmer said he would be more than glad to sell him one, stuck a deal, and the city slicker continued down the gravel road on to another farm with his rabbit under one arm.

The city slicker comes to the next farm, walks up the dirt driveway again, looks around for the farmer, then tells him he is looking to purchase a hen. The farmer replied ""Around here we don't call them hens, we call them pullets"".

The city slicker thanked the farmer, then said he would like to purchase a pullet if he could from the farmer. The farmer said he has plenty to spare and would be glad to sell him one.

They struck a deal and the city slicker was on his way again down the gravel road, now with one peter and one pullet under each arm.

He reached the last farm on the end of the road, walked up to the farmer and told him he was interested in purchasing a mule, and asked if he had one he could sell. The farmer replied ""Around here we don't call them mules, we call them Ass's"".

Again, the city slicker thanked the farmer and said he would like to purchase an Ass if he had one he could spare.

The farmer said he had only one he could spare, and that is was a hard working Ass, but he did have a catch. The city slicker was a little concerned and asked what was wrong with the Ass. The farmer said the mule will be working and pulling nice and hard, and then suddenly stop dead in his tracks, BUT all you had to do was scratch him behind his ear, and he would go right back to work.

The city slicker thought that was no real big deal and that he could easily handle that. So city slicker struck up a deal with the farmer and decided to head home with a cock under his right arm, a pullet under his left arm, and the Ass walking beside him.

He was almost home when the Ass stopped dead in his tracks right in front of a lady working in her flower garden along the road.

The city slicker looked a little distressed, so the lady asked if she could help him. He replied.......""Could you hold my peter and pullet while I scratch my Ass?"" ",0,2015-01-05

This is what you need to do: get a bucket, put a dead fish in it, piss in it, pour in a bottle of vodka and a glass of gasoline, then mix it all together with a stick. Cover it and let it sit for a few days, then take a good long whiff of it every day for one week.”

The Taxman decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the Tax office.

The taxman was not surprised when Grandpa showed up with his accountant.

The taxman said, 'Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the tax office finds that believable.'

'I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,' says Grandpa. 'How about a demonstration?'

The taxman thinks for a moment and said, 'Okay. Go ahead.'

Grandpa says, 'I'll bet you a thousand pounds that I can bite my own eye.'

The taxman thinks a moment and says, 'It's a bet.'

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The taxman's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, 'Now, I'll bet you two thousand pounds that I can bite my other eye.'

Now the taxman can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his false teeth and bites his good eye.

The stunned taxman now realises he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's accountant as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

'Want to go double or nothing?', Grandpa asks? 'I'll bet you six thousand pounds that I can stand on this side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.'

The taxman, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old man could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much pees all over the taxman's desk.

The taxman leaps with joy, realising that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa's own accountant moans and puts his head in his hands.

'Are you okay?', the taxman asks.

'Not really,' says the accountant. 'This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand pounds that he could come in here and piss all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!'

They decide that it would be symbolic to have their funeral together, because they were so close through life that they would like their lives to be celebrated together in death.

The pallbearers bring out a single coffin, to which the families are confused.

The funeral director asks the eulogist why there's only one casket, he informs them that because of the sudden amount of casualties in a small fishing town it was all they were able to build so quickly. ""Not to worry, because they have everyone covered with this one.""

The family absolutely loses it upon hearing this news. The tears turn to anger and in a rampaging outburst they trample the eulogist to death.

The funeral director is asked to serve as a witness in the courtroom. At his testimony, the judge asks ""How could you say he should have expected this in good faith?""

A little while later a bear came out of the tree line on the other side of the river. The hunter pulled up his gun and put the sights on the bear. Just as he did this a really large water fly started hovering in his line of sight. He thought angrily to himself that fly better drop out of sight quick.

As this occurred there was a mouse eye balling the hunters lunch. The mouse said to itself, if that fly just dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, would jump in his boat, and forget his lunch.

Simultaneously, a hawk was watching the mouse from a tree high above. The hawk said to itself, if the fly dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, jump in his boat, forget his lunch, and the mouse will come out from undercover.

Also, while this was occurring, a bobcat was monitoring the same situation. The bobcat said to itself that if the fly dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, jump in his boat, forget his lunch, and the mouse will come out from undercover.

Well, the fly finally dropped 6in and the hunter took his shot, jumped in the boat, and forgot his lunch. Once the shore was clear the mouse charged the lunch, the hawk swooped, and as the cat pounced the hawk swiped the mouse, and the Bob cat flew into the river.

The moral of the story is, when the fly drops 6in the pussy gets wet.

loopmoploop,"Once upon a time, there was an Egyptian named Benny ||| One day, Benny was strolling along the banks of the Nile, minding his own business. However, he came across an urn, buried in the sand. The urn was all dusty and dented and cracked and bent and generally broken. But Benny thought, hey, I can probably get a few coins from this, so he rubbed the urn on his sleeve. But suddenly, out of the urn came a genie!

The genie stretched and yawned and said: ""Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't tell you how long I've been in that urn! You're a lucky man, fella. Very lucky.""

""Why?"" said Benny.

""Because you've got wishes coming your way, friend. Three, to be exact.""

So Benny thought for a while and said, ""Ok, I want some new threads."" And he got a spiffy new toga. And then he said ""I could use a new house."" And his little mud hut turned into a fabulous marble mansion.

Finally, Benny said: ""And, for my final wish, I'd like to be immortal. I wanna live forever.""

The genie was taken back a bit and thought for a while: ""Well, that's, um, that's a bit of an expensive wish, you see. Hm. Tell you what. I'll make you immortal, but on one condition. You can never, ever, shave your beard or cut your hair. If you do, you're gonna get sucked into an urn, like me. Deal?""

""Deal,"" said Benny.

So the genie granted his wish and flew off into the Sahara. Benny began wandering the world, and he saw Rome rise and fall, the Dark Ages get lighter, the New World grow and prosper. He went all over the planet, from north to south to east to west. But all this time, Benny had never fallen in love.

But one day, Benny was walking along a beach, and he spotted a beautiful woman. He walked up to her and introduced himself. And as the woman brushed the hair out of his face they gazed into each other's eyes, and it was love at first sight. They danced and they laughed and they sung, and it was a happy time for both of them.

One day, on the same beach they had met on, Benny got down on one knee and asked the woman to marry him. The woman thought for a while.

""Benny,"" she said, ""I'll marry you. But only if you shave your beard and cut your hair. It's long and dirty and full of rats, and whenever we go to see a movie it takes up the entire aisle. I just can't live with it.""

Benny sat down and mulled this over. The Genie and the urn were long gone, he thought, and besides, he loved this girl, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. He happily agreed, and went to the pharmacy and bought about 500 cans of shaving cream and 200 disposable razors.

When he got back to his apartment, he gave his girlfriend a kiss and went into the bathroom and shut the door. You could hear the *chic, chic* of the razor and the *pst, pst* of the shaving cream. But then, suddenly, it all went quiet.

At first, his girlfriend thought, well, ok, maybe he's just taking his time, but eventually she started to get concerned, and after a while, she knocked on the door. 

""Benny?""

She knocked again, louder.

""Benny?""

She knocked once more, even louder.

""BENNY?""

Finally she pushed open the door, and on the ground lay around 50 cubic meters of hair, and an urn.

So, there's a moral to this story.

And that moral is, that a Benny shaved, is a Benny urned.",16,2015-01-07

On his twenty first birthday I took him to a bar, plopt him down on the bar and got ourselves two beers. I cracked one open and my son knocked it back. All of a sudden a torso shot out from were his neck should be. Stunned I gave him another beer and arms shot out of his torso. People around the bar began to notice and started cheering him on to keep drinking. After every drink another miracle would happen around the bar. At two in the morning I told my son we better get heading home. He begged me to let him have one more drink and was encouraged by the crowd, so I ordered our last drink and gave it to him.

So, the father goes in and he says to his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want one green golf ball.""  The father things green golf ball but he doesn't have time to really ask about it.  He rushes out to the nearest store and gets his son one green golf ball.  He takes it back to the hospital where he places it next to his son's bed.  The next morning the boy is alive and well.  The doctor releases him and he goes home.  A number of years have passed now.  The son is about to go to college.  A very nice university actually, lots of activities, girls, and even a few guys for a possible experimentation phase but I digress. He is moving into this dorm room when his parents sit him down and tell him how proud him they are and now that he won't be home as much they don't feel they can live together and they will be getting a divorce.  The son says he understands and all go home to finish getting his stuff for his room.  The next day the son is sick and they rush him to the hospital.  The doctor says to the parents, ""We've run all the tests and we are afraid your son will not make it.""  The father goes and asks the son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want a bucket full of green golf balls.""  The dad thinks to himself, ""Those damn green golf balls again."" But he doesn't think anything more of it.  He rushes out to the nearest sporting store and purchases a bucket and fills it up with green golf balls.  He hurries back to the hospital where he places the bucket next to his son's bed.  The next day the boy is alive and well, then shortly released and goes back to college.  He works very hard during his time there and decides to go into Law.  He is now working as an intern at a prestigous law office in downtown Chicago,  His parents come to visit him one weekend where he shows them the great work he is doing and how close he is to becoming a lawyer.  After all this his parents set him down and explain to him how they have been living all these years in misery and how they must get this divorce.  The son says he understands and they go back to his apartment.  The next day the boy is very sick and he is rushed to the hospital.  The doctor is reviewing his charts and the new tests and said to the parents, ""I'm afraid there is nothing we can do for you son, he is going to die.""  The father goes in and asks his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son's responese, ""I want I wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.""  The father rushes out and gets for his son this wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.  He rolls up next to the bed and the next day the son is alive and well.  He goes home and continues his work as an attorney.  During this time he meets a beautiful young woman who he decides that he will marry.  On the night of the rehearsal dinner everything is perfect. His parents come up to him and father says, ""I see how much you love your fiance and those words mean so much to your mother and me. However, we no longer feel that way towards one another and we are going to get divorced."" The son tells his parents that he understands and they go back to the hotel rooms.  Overnight the son becomes very sick.  They rush him to the hospital where the doctor comes up to the family and expresses his opinion and sorrow for their son's condition.  He tells them he doesn't feel he will make it this time.  The father goes into the room and asks his son, ""What can I get you befor you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want one truckload of green golf balls."" The father asks his friend to borrow his pick up truck and rushes out and fills it to the brim with green golf balls.  He parks outside the window where his son can see the truck and its load of green golf balls.  The son looks out his window and lays back down.  The next day the son is well and alive and the wedding goes on.  Years have passed, the son has children, and the parents are in their twilight years.  They come to visit their son and grandchildren.  While on the porch the father says to the son, ""You have a wonderful life with your own family and career now.  Your mother and I aren't going to be around much longer and we don't want to live our lives in misery. We MUST get divorced so we can be happy in these remaining years.""  The son says he understands and they all go in and head to bed.  The next day the son is very ill.  He is rushed to the hospital.  The doctor reviews all his records from the first incident to the last and says to the family, ""I'm sorry but he isn't going to make it.  I don't care how many green golf balls this man gets.""  So, the father goes and says to his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son responds with, ""I want two truck loads of  green golf balls.""  The father rushes out and rents to huge semis and fills them both with green golf balls from the tri-state area.  He brings the trucks back to the hospital where he parks them for the son to see.  He raises his head and lays back down. The next day the son is no better.  Everyone is crying and the father goes and asks his son, ""Before you go I need to know why all these years did you want green golf balls?""  The son raises his head and says to his father,""Because, because, because....."" and then he dies.  --- You have now read the green golf ball joke and your time doing so belongs to me!! ",2,2015-01-07

Only problem was, since then she had this lingering darkness to her and this raised some concerns. One morning before work I question her on this and she breaks into tears. She met Joe and the child is likely his! She no longer feels like she could be with me after her affair. I demanded she leave my house and never return. In a rage I grabbed my shotgun and stormed to the oilfield in hopes of finding Joe there.

I see him and I hit his face with the butt of my gun with all my force. Before I could pull the trigger on this womanizer I was apprehended by my coworkers.

hornetsting,"Husband takes a break from his wife. |||   A wife and her husband were having marital problems.  She wanted a better relationship than he was providing.  He was always tired and sat on the couch watching tv.  He was not interested in having sex, doing yard work or much of anything.  
  
She made an appointment for him to see a doctor.  In talking with the doctor, he is told that a much needed vacation is in order.  To go home and have his wife leave for a week and then come back.  That should give him all the alone time he needs to get back on track.  The man is excited and goes home to tell her the news.

  She is willing to do whatever, so she packs a bag amidst him telling her to “hurry the hell up and get out!”  She quickly explains that she has made all of his meals and they are labeled in the refrigerator.  The dog food is also in the refrigerator and not to forget to feed the dog.  The man is in such a hurry doesn’t listen and rushes her along.
  
  Soon after she is gone he gets hungry.  He goes to the fridge find some hamburger patties wrapped up ready to fry and makes him a hamburger.  Shortly after he starts to feel great, he cleans the whole house, the yard and works on several projects around the house.  He just can’t seem to eat enough of those hamburgers.  

  By weeks end she returns to find the house immaculate, the yard maintained and all of her projects done.  She asks him what has happened and he throws her on the bed and makes mad passionately love to her.  She is so swept away and in awe she can hardly contain herself.  He tells her about how the burgers she left for him made him a changed man.  

   She doesn’t understand and tells him that she left no burgers for him.  She goes to the fridge to find that all of the Gaines burger dog food is gone.  She tells him that he’s been eating dog food.  The man doesn’t care and continues to eat them.  

   She calls the doctor and explains what is going on.  The doctor reassures her that if it has changed him and she likes it, not to worry about it.  The dog food won’t hurt him.  

   Two weeks later the woman calls the doctor again crying and sobbing, tells the doctor that her husband died.  The doctor said he cannot believe the man died from eating dog food?  She exclaims “no he was in the middle of the road licking his dick and a truck ran him over!”

^^[listen.to.it.here](http://vimeo.com/109935412)

There was a poor dirt farming family in Ireland. All they had was this one milk cow. The would turn the milk to cheese and sell at the market to buy food.

Well, one morning, the father wakes up and sees the milk cow dead. So he hangs himself in the tree.

The mother wakes up, sees the milk cow dead and her husband hanging from the tree and throws herself into the river and she washes up on the shore.

The oldest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanged and, by his mother who has washed up on the shore, a leprechaun - a female leprechaun.

She says "" Looks like you're having a bad day"". he say ""I should say so."" She says ""i'll make you a deal, if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring your mom and dad back, and even the milk cow"".

He says ""why not?"". He almost makes it but fails, so she kills him.

The next son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanging and his mother and brother dead by the shore near the leprechaun.

She tells him ""if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring you father, mother and brother back, and also the milk cow"". He agrees. He doesn't make it either, so the leprechaun kills him.

The youngest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, the father hanging from the tree, and his mother and two brothers dead by the shore, and the female leprechaun.

She tells him ""if you make love to me 10 times in a row, without stopping, I'll bring your father, mother and two brothers back, and even the milk cow"".

He says ""Well, look at you and look at me, I'm young and virile, let's try it. BUT, what if I make love to you 15 times in a row?""

She says, ""In that case, I'll bring your father, mother and brothers back, even the milk cow and give you nice mansion where your hovel is"".

He says ""That's fine and all, but what if I make love to you 20 times in a row?""

She says ""If you make love to me 20 times in a row, I'll bring your entire family back, even the milk cow, give you mansion where your hovel is and give you a big pot of gold and you'll be set for life"".

He says ""alright let's get started in a minute, but first, if I make love to you 20 times in a row, what's to stop YOU from dying? The milk cow did.""

Let me prove its to you.” He snaps his fingers, and pats his hand atop the bar, and the alligator slowly climbs up on top of the bar. The man then unzips his pants, pulls out his package and sticks it in the alligators mouth. The alligator doesn’t move, and just sits there with his mouth open. After about five minutes, the man pulls it out of the alligator’s mouth and zips up his pants. The bartender is completely amazed, completely speechless. The man then says, “See, I told you he was tame, told you he was trained…. Hey does anyone else want to give it a try? I’ll buy you a drink if you give it a try…” The drunk down at the end of the bar speaks up and says, “Yah, I’ll give it a shot, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep my mouth open that long….”

14. Peter heard his Lord speak his name, but no more, so he quickly tried to climb up and hear if Jesus had any last words. 15. Yet in his haste he slipped and fell and sprained his right knee, even as Jesus had said that morning, 16.""You need to be careful, Peter, or you will sprain your knee one day.""

17. ""Peter,"" spake the Lord again.

18. Then did Peter resolve to hear his Lord's voice. 19. He reached for and climbed the cross, only to lose his grip and fall again, breaking the bones in his left hand.

20. ""Peter,"" Jesus said one last time, and his voice was fraught with death.""

21. At this, Peter found himself imbued with the Holy Spirit, and thus did he climb. 22. Reaching the apex of the cross, he wrapped himself onto it and touched Jesus' face.

23. ""My Lord! It is I!"" spake Peter. ""Peter, your servant.""

24. ""Peter,"" the Lord said, softly now. 25. ""I think I can see your house. from here.""",5,2015-01-08

So one day an old nun and young nun decide to ride their bikes into the city to pick up supplies for that night’s dinner. On their ride into the city, they take the short road. They get into the city do, their shopping, and return home by the same route. They do this every night for the next week. One night, however, the old nun says, “Sister, let’s take the scenic route home tonight. I think you’ll really enjoy it.”

So that night, after their shopping, the nuns ride their bikes home via the scenic route. It’s a beautiful ride, with rolling hills and a wonderful view of the sunset. However, during the ride, the younger nun began to make noises.

“Oh,” she said, quietly at first, and then louder and louder. “Oh! Ooh!” The older nun finally took notice. She looked back, winked, and said to the younger nun as they bounced over the cobblestone road, “So you like this road, huh?” to which the younger nun replies, “Yeah -- oh! -- I’ve never come this way before!”",133,2015-01-08

He puts down six beers and a couple of shots, so naturally he has to piss. He walks into the men's room and stands in front of the urinal and begins to do his business. 

He hears the door open and hears someone walk in. He notices that the man is a leprechaun. 4 foot nothing and wearing all green and smoking a cigar.

The intoxicated man is startled and lets out a ""holy shit, your a leprechaun""!

The Leprechaun looks over to him and say ""aye"" and pulls out a 14"" cock and lets it unroll into the urinal and it splashes around like a loose fire hose.

The intoxicated man shakes his head and zips up to run out of the toilet. He sits back down at the bar and orders another beer and a double shot so he may forget what he just saw... But, he can't. He nervously watches for the leprechaun as nobody seems to mind his presence. 

After an hour or so, the leprechaun goes back into the bathroom and the man goes in to follow him. 

The man has the leprechaun cornered and says, 

""hey leprakon... you grant wisshhess right?""

""aye, laddy! What can I do fer ya?""

""I wan't a 14"" cock just like you gots""

""well laddy, that is a very special wish. I can only make that wish come true if ya do something very special for me""

""Yeah, what?""

""well me boy, I'm gonna need to take you into that there stall and fuck your arse with me 14"" cock""

""fuck that shit!""

The man walks out of the restroom and leans against the wall next to the door and starts thinking about how great it would be to have a 14"" cock. After a few moments he decides to suck it up and get it over with to have a huge dick.

He walks back into the bathroom and the leprechaun is in there waiting for him.

""I see ya changed your mind, laddy""

""whatever lepakon. Just get it over with""

The man drops trou and grabs a hold of the toilet and the leprechaun starts going to town on his ass. Right in the middle of this destruction, the leprechaun asks,

""What is your name lad?""

""ah! Fuck! My name is Mike!"" Mike lets out in a tortured scream.

""Mike, How old are you lad?""

""Ah Fuck! I'm 26, for the love of god, why?""

**""Mike! YOU ARE 26 AND YOU STILL BELIEVE IN LEPRECHAUNS?""**

gooddavid99,"the moral of the story... ||| A fish is swimming in the pond and looks up and sees a fly just out of reach, and thinks to himself,
"" if that fly drops just six inches I'll jump up and have a nice lunch!""
While the fish is swimming under the fly a bear is watching from the shore. he sees the fish following the fly and thinks,
""If that fly drops six inches that fish will jump up to get him, and I'll jump out and get him and have a nice lunch!""
Up the shore is a hunter watching the bear. He sees the bear watching the fish watching the fly and thinks,
""If that fly drops six inches that fish will jump to get it, the bear will jump out to get him and i'll get a clear shot and have a nice lunch!""
 In the weeds a mouse is watching the hunter ( and the cheese sandwich beside him), sees the bear, the fish and the fly and thinks,
"" If that fly drops six inches the fish will jump up, the bear will jump out, the hunter will shoot the bear and when he goes to get him I'll run over and get that sandwich and have a nice lunch!""
In a tree next to the weeds, a cat is watching the mouse. He sees the hunter( and the sandwich), the bear, the fish and the fly and thinks,
"" If that fly drops six inches the fish will jump up, the bear will jump out, the hunter will shoot, the mouse will dash out and I'll pounce on the mouse and have a nice lunch!""
So in the fullness of time the fly drops six inches, the fish jumps out tp get him, the bear leaps out to snatch him, the hunter shoots and walks over, the mouse dashes out and the cat pounces!!!!....and over shoots and ends up in the pond.

So the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in.

Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After a while, they've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is becoming a pretty popular guy.

One day God calls Satan up on the telephone and asks with a sneer, 

""So, how's it going down there in hell?"" 

Satan replies, ""Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.""

God replies, ""What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake — he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."" 

Satan says, ""No way! I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him.""

God says, ""Send him back up here or I'll sue.""

parsar01,"Pope and a Jew ||| Several centuries ago, the Pope decided in all his wisdom that all the Jews had to leave the Vatican. 

Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community. 

So the Pope cut a deal a juicy deal.

He would have a religious debate with any chosen member of the Jewish community. If this Jew won, the Jews could stay.  If the Pope won, the Jews would have to leave.

The Jews realized that they had no choice.

So they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them.  Rabbi Moishe's Latin wasn't very good - in fact, he knew very little --- but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community.

The pope agreed. What could be easier than a silent debate?

The day of the great debate came.

Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute sizing up each other , before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger.

The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat.
The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple.

The Pope stood up and said, ""I give up. This man is just too good. The Jews can stay.""

An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened.

The Pope said: ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity.  He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. 

Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us.  He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. 

I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins.  He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin.

He had an instant answer for everything. What could I do?""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. ""What happened?"" they asked.

""Well,"" said Moishe, ""First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. 

Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.""

""And then?"" prodded a Jewish woman.

""I don't know,"" said Moishe. ""He took out his effin’ lunch and so I took out mine.""

The Pope replied that he could not do that.

The Pope said that he still could not do that.

The brothers made their final offer - 10 million dollars.

The Pope, exasperated at this point tells them that he does not have the authority to change the Lord's prayer.

'This is a magic dildo' she says 'all you have to do is say 'magic dildo' followed by the name of what you want it to pleasure'

Not surprisingly the man does not believe this far-fetched claim and asks for a demonstration, so the assistant says 'magic dildo, the door knob' and sure enough the magic dildo proceeds to pleasures the door knob.

'Now' she interrupted' to stop it you say 'magic dildo, Oklahoma' or give it a new command to pleasure something else.

Satisfied with the product the man makes the purchase and goes home to his wife, he explains to her the ins and outs of the new toy and sets off on his trip, safe in the knowledge that his wife will not stray.

His wife, back at home and not long after he has left begins to feel horny and says 'magic dildo, my vagina'

The dildo gets to work quickly and she has orgasm after orgasm until she can take no more.

Suddenly she realises she cannot remember the command to stop the dildo and is stuck for hours getting more and more exhausted, until she decides that she has no choice but to drive to the hospital.

She is driving to the hospital and swerving all over the road as she has orgasm after orgasm, struggling to control the car. It's not long until she is spotted by a policeman, who naturally assumes she is a drunk driver.

He pulls her over and she winds down her window to talk to him as he approaches.

He asks her to exit the car as he suspects she is drunk, but she protests, stating that she cannot move, she can barely feel her legs anymore.

'Exit the car please ma'am so We can do a sobriety test' the policeman demands getting short on patience.

'I can't!' Exclaimed the driver 'I have a magic dildo working its magic on me and I can't remember the command to stop it'

'Ha!' The police laughs 'magic dildo, my arse!'

And it's not without a tear in his eye that he flips the front door's brass mail slot to push the last delivery of his professional life into the house. 

And in that very same moment, Mrs. Applebaum opens the door to greet him - dressed in a skimpy black neglige. 

Mr. Simon is speechless as she grabs him by the shirt and yanks him into the house. His packet of letters drops to the floor of the entry way and spills out into the foyer.     Mrs Applebaum then leads him up to the bedroom where she proceeds to boink the living daylights out of Mr. Simon - for 15 solid minutes.  

Afterwards, she leads him back downstairs and serves up the most amazing freakin' post coital breakfast a man could ever hope to have.

All the kosher bacon he could eat.   Home made Belgian waffles with whipped cream.  Warm maple syrup.   All manner of carmelized fruit.  Fresh squeezed OJ.  And of course - gourmet french roast coffee.

Mr. Simon feels like he's died and gone to heaven.   At length, he takes of sip of his delicious piping hot coffee and looks up at bare-naked Mrs. Applebaum sitting across the table from him - her soft round million dollar boobies aglow.

""Mrs. Applebaum.   Today I've received more thoughtful gifts from grateful mail recipients than I could have ever imagined.   But this.   This is something special.   Would it be too much trouble to ask why?""

""Don't be ridiculous!"" starts Mrs. Applebaum.  ""Last night I said to Morty.   Hey.  It's our favorite mail man's last day tomorrow.  Shouldn't we do something nice for him?""    

""My idea was to make you a wonderful breakfast."" explains Mrs. Applebaum. ""The rest is from Morty.""

Mr. Simon is just stupefied as Mrs Applebaum directs him to open the envelope next to his plate on the table.

And he's utterly at a loss as he yanks out the envelope's contents.  A single dollar bill.  He look up at Mrs. Applebaum imploringly.

""Yeah.  A dollar"", confirms Mrs. Applebaum.   ""That's what Morty said.  'Fuck um. Give um a dollar'""

Irv invites Morty to his condo where they share a little lunch and catch up on old times.  They light up cigars and Morty says “Irv…? I  gotta tell ya.  I’m not sure this retirement thing is for me.  I’m absolutely climbing the walls with boredom.”

Irv:  “Bored?  Acch bored.  I’m never bored.  You just gotta get y’self a hobby.”

Morty:  “A hobby? Whaddya mean ‘a hobby.’”

Irv:  “A hobby.  Like me.  Ever since I got a hobby I haven’t been more fulfilled, or happier.  Honestly.”

Morty:  “I can’t even imagine you – knowing you – having a hobby.  What kind of hobby you got?”

Irv:  “Beekeeping.”
 
Morty:  “Beekeeping?  Whaddya mean BEE-keeping.”

Irv:   “I’m a beekeeper.  I keep bees.”

Morty:  “YOU… are a beekeeper.”

Irv:  “That’s right.  And I gotta tell ya Morty – I feel wonderful!  Occupied, yet utterly relaxed…”

Morty:  “But-- where you gonna keep bees?!  You gotta big hunk a land somewhere down here?”

Irv:  “No.  No no – right here.”

Morty:  “Here in town – in Boca?”

Irv:  “No right here.  In my condo.”

Morty:  “You can’t keep bees in a condo – whaddya talkin’ about.”

Irv:   “Yeah.  I keep the bees  in my closet.”

Morty:  “You keep ‘em in your CLOSET?  Bees?”

Irv:  “Sure!  In a shoebox.  Wanna see?”

Morty:  “--In a shoeb-- Well of COURSE I wanna see – I cannot believe this otherwise!”

So Irv leads Morty into his bedroom, steps up on a chair, and reaches far up into a top corner shelf in the closet to bring out a shoebox…which he begins to carefully open…

Morty:  “Whoa-whoa!  How many bees you got in there?!”

Irv:  “Oh I don’t know.  Few dozen maybe - who counts.  Look—“

Morty (peers in)  “What’s that?  I just see a bunch of balls of tin foil.”

Irv:   “That’s what I wrap them in.”

Morty:  “Wait.  You wrap the bees in tin foil?”

Irv:  “Sure.  That’s how I keep them.  See?”

Irv slowly, delicately unwraps one of the tin foil balls to reveal a bee.

Morty:  “But… this bee is dead.”

Irv:  “Oh yeah.  They all are.""

Morty:  “They’re all dead?!  What kinda beekeeper ARE you with a bunch of dead bees...?!

The Bunny procceeds by asking for a brand new motorcycle, which appears promptly. However, the bear turns to scold his counterpart. ""I don't think you're thinking big enough with these wishes. You don't come across nearly limitless powers like this every day. Anyways, I believe I was next? For my 2nd wish: I wish all the other bears besides me were attracted to me.""

The rabbit is slightly frustrated by the bear's outburst, but he tries to remind himself that his buddy has the rabbit's best intrests at heart and proceeds. ""Okay, I wish the tank on my new bike was always full.""

His first customer of the day, an Italian with a strong accent, is after a personal loan, but doesn't have that much in the way of assets or a decent credit rating so Patrick is iffy on granting the loan straightaway, but asks the customer if he has any collateral.

""Oh-a, just a few knick-knacks, I'm afraid, I'm-a not-a sure they'll be-a worth much...""

""Well, you obviously thought that they might be worth something or you wouldn't have mentioned them,"" Patrick replies, ""so why don't you go get them and I'll have a look.""

The potential customer headed out of the bank to grab his collateral, passing by Patrick's boss on the way out, and Patrick quickly explained the circumstances. His boss is a little more dismissive of the knick-knacks than Patrick (and Patrick knows that the boss is somewhat dismissive of 'wogs' in general) but the customer's gone to get them anyways, so the boss headed back to his office but left the door open to observe Patrick and the customer, now returning with a scruffy wooden box.

Patrick looked askance at the box as the customer puts it down on the desk, but then his jaw dropped in astonishment as the box is opened to reveal what looks like a Faberge egg in near perfect condition. As Patrick is desperately trying to recover his composure, he hears his boss yell out from the office:

The first thief shook his head a little bit, giving his water glass a forlorn frown. ""The market for gems has dried up. What little I manage to get my hands on is hard to sell, and what money I get seems to flitter away before I know what I've done with it. It is impossible to make a dishonest living these days.""

The second thief shook her head a little bit more, poking at her plate with her fork. ""You think that's bad? The market for trade secrets is all but gone. There are teenagers around the world who will do for fun what I used to do to feed my family. It is impossible to make a dishonest living these days.""

The third thief shook his head just a little, as well, smiling softly at his friends from over his wine glass. ""It pains me to hear of your troubles, friends. Would you allow me to pick up the tab today?""

The offer was met with grumbles and protests.

""How is it we're struggling to make ends meet, but you're here with your bottle of wine and your sly smile?"", they asked. ""Diamonds are worthless and secrets are whispered across the playgrounds, and yet here you are, hale and hearty!""

The third thief rolled his shoulders in a shrug. ""Art,"" he said, simply.

""Art?""

""Art. There is always a market for art. Art never goes out of style. Proceeds from gemstones are fleeting; cash garnered for information is as ephemeral as the goods you barter. You steal one fine painting, however, and the money will keep you for years and years. As simple as that.""

The other two thieves muttered and grumbled again, exchanging glances of doubt and disbelief, until the third thief held his hands up to silence them. He leaned in, and his companions leaned in as well, to hear his wisdom.

""It is a lesson we all learned on the playgrounds of our youth,"" he says. ""...you know what they say: Take a picture. It'll last longer.""",3,2015-01-11

""Excuse me, sir, but I'm in need of a place to sleep for the night,"" the farmhand said.

The farmer replied, ""Well, son, lucky for you, I have a cozy little area in my barn where you can sleep for as long as you want. All you have to do for me is tend to my fields.""

The farmhand agreed and went to the barn, where he found an enormous pile of straw, which he figured was the farmer's entire stockpile for the year.

""That's the largest pile of straw I've ever seen!"" he said to himself. ""I wonder what all that straw on fire would look like!""

The young farmhand then lit the pile on fire, and watched the straw burn. The farmer, awoken by the bright light outside, came running to the barn. 

""What are you doing?!"" he asked.

""It was an accident, sir. It won't happen again.""

The farmer, angry but understanding, put out the fire, and walked off back to bed.

The next day, after tending to the fields, the young farmhand thought about the pile of straw again. 

""I wish I could see it *all* on fire,"" he thought to himself.

So, later that night, he lit the pile on fire again.

Again, the farmer came running out, shocked by what he was seeing

""Sir, my lamp fell over, and spilled hot oil on the straw,"" the farmhand cried.

""Help me put this out, boy, and don't let it happen again, or you're done for,"" the farmer said.

The next day, the farmhand just couldn't help himself. He **had** to see that pile of straw burn in a blaze of glory. 

Late at night, in the early hours of the morning, the farmhand lit the pile of straw on fire. This time, the farmer was fast asleep, and didn't notice the inferno happening until nearly the entire pile had been incinerated. The farmer came running outside, where he found the farmhand standing next to the charred and completely straw-barren barn.

The next day the teacher says, ""Okay everyone lets listen to your stories. Susie you are up first.""

Susie says ""We live on a farm and I was collecting eggs from the hen house one day. I gathered the eggs and put them in my basket and set off running toward the house. While running I tripped over a rock and smashed all of the eggs."" 

""So what's the moral of the story Susie?"" Asked the teacher.

""Don't put all of your eggs in one basket,"" said Susie.

Next it was Billy's turn to go.

""We also live on a farm,"" said Billy. ""We have incubators to help our eggs hatch. One night there was a thunderstorm and lightning knocked out the power to the incubators.""

""So what's the moral of that story Billy?"" Asked the teacher.

""Don't count your chickens before they hatch,"" said Billy.

Next was little Johnny's turn.

""So my Uncle Bob was about 15 clicks outside of De Nang during the Vietnam War,"" said little Johnny. ""He was hanging his head out of a chopper when he spied 100 North Vietnamese Regulars marching toward his platoon. Bob had a parachute, an M-60, a machete, and a full handle of Jack Daniels. So Bob leaps out of the chopper, downs his bottle of Jack, and then opens his chute. As soon as he lands he starts firing. His gun looks like a dragon barking fire. He takes out 65 Zipper Heads before he runs out of bullets. Then he pulls out his machete and starts hacking precisely like a surgeon at the Gooks. He slaughters another 25 before his machete gets stuck in some poor bastard's head. Uncle Bob then balls up his fists and starts swinging at the remaining son's of bitches. He kills the final ten men with his bare hands.""

As soon as he walked through the door at home, his wife started on him about, 'What time of night to be getting home is this? Where have you been? Dinner is cold and I'm not reheating it'.  And on and on and on.

Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he poured himself a shot of whiskey and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub, pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks as he dragged himself up the stairs.

While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was told that her husband's client, James Edward Wright, had been granted a stay of execution after all. 

Finally realizing what a terrible day he must have had, she decided to go upstairs and give him the good news.

As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of her husband, bent over naked, drying his legs and feet.

'They're not hanging Wright tonight,' she said.

He exits the bar and searches for his horse, only to find out that his horse is not there anymore. Infuriated he went back in the bar and screams out loud:'Who stole my horse?' 

The bar remaining dead silent, leaving the man to no other option then screaming: 'If no one tells me where my horse is, the same will happen as in 1989, and I do not like to let that happen again...'

With everyone in the bar now terrified, no one dared to speak up or tell the angry cowboy anything. The cowboy repeats himself one more time: 'I do not want to let the same thing happen as in 1989, remember that y'all.'

At that moment, one brave man dares to speak up and ask the mad cowboy what happened back in 1989. 'Then, then I went back home by foot.'",1,2015-01-12

''What about the green one?'' the man asks.
The assistant says, ''He costs $5000 because he knows typewriting and can answer incoming telephone calls and takes notes.''

aurthurallan,"""The Frogs in Prague Defy Catalog"" |||   According to a research team at Charles University in Prague, the local amphibians have very peculiar migratory habits. In recent years, a new sub-species have been identified which is not native to the area around the Czech capitol. The research has been carried out with the help of many students and locals who have volunteered to contribute information about sightings and descriptions of these curious frogs, and upload this information to the research team's online catalog where it can be categorized and evaluated. This sort of grassroots (or perhaps toadstool) approach to data collection has been viewed by many skeptics as unorthodox, but it has yielded fast results. In the last few months, the team has been able to establish the spread of the new frogs throughout the surrounding community, but has yet to discover their origin or method of transportation.

""Frogs are not typically great migrators,"" says Professor Jacob Kroka, ""They require large amounts of water for breeding and for food supply purposes. They do not travel easily over dry or mountainous areas.""

Professor Kroka has suggested that perhaps predatory birds are responsible for the introduction of the unidentified species into Prague's streams and ponds. 

""Obviously we're not talking about sparrows here. It would have to be a large bird like a heron or pelican that feed at the waters edge. It seems unlikely, but possibly a few live frogs or perhaps some frog eggs escaped the meal and made it back into the ecosystem."" Kroka continues, ""What I believe we have here is a hybridization of two species--one native and one from a neighboring area.""

Early DNA results seems to corroborate Kroka's hybridization theory. While the two species that interbred have not been definitively identified, they have narrowed down the geographical scope. One of the parents, as per Kroka's suspicion, appears to be local. As for the other parent, Kroka states ""It seems from our DNA analysis that they are all a tad Polish.""",3,2015-01-12

""Don't do that! There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.""
Jeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:
“You have tennis elbow.
Soak your arm in warm water.
Avoid heavy lifting.
It will be better in two weeks.”
    Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.
    He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:
“Your tap water is too hard.
Get a water softener.

Your dog has worms.
Get him vitamins.

Your daughter's using cocaine.
Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.

Your wife's pregnant - twin girls.
They aren't yours.
Get a lawyer.
And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.”",82,2015-01-12

Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position. The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, and held up a handwritten sign that said ""WHERE AM I?"" in large letters. People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it in a building window. Their sign said ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.""

Johnny lets out a ""What"" and is facing the next question. ""Looks like you are not doing well. The next one is a pretty simple one. The Lion is hosting an animal conference. All the animals attend.... except one. Which animal does not attend?""

Little Johnny doesn't bother thinking much on this before he gives up. Dad says ""The Elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator. You just put him in there.""

""Like what?"" The grandson inquired.

""When I was your age, some buddies of mine and I went to Paris for the most insane night of debauchery and fun we'd ever had!  We got into the most expensive clubs, ran up a huge tab, and got out of paying for a dime of it!  We waltzed into the priciest restaraunts without reservations and talked our way into getting a free meal immediately.  We went to the hottest strip clubs and got free lap dances, and I even had sex with a stripper onstage and nobody dared to fuck with me and my buddies! We were unstoppable!""

The grandfather smiled as he reminisced, remembering fondly his days in Paris.  The younger man furrowed his brow and nodded.

""You know what grandpa?  You're right.  I do need to go out and do something with my life!  I'm gonna grab my buddies and go to Paris, and do the exact same things you did!""

""Atta boy,"" the elderly man responded.


Two weeks later, the young man came home from Paris.  However, when the expectant grandfather opened the door, he found his grandson in a sling, a neckbrace, and with two horribly black eyes.



""What the fuck happened to you?!"" grandpa asked.

""I did all the same stuff you did!"" The man replied in dismay.  ""We went to the best clubs, drank up a huge tab, but when we tried to leave without paying, the bouncer beat the shit out of me and broke my arm!  We tried to push our way into a restaurant, but when we wouldn't leave the police were called and gave me these two black eyes with their night sticks!  And worst of all, we went to a strip club, and when I tried to fuck a stripper onstage, I was nearly beaten to death by all the bouncers at once!""

edit: When I heard this joke it was ""Ukrainian sausage"". I searched /r/jokes for ""which aisle ukrainian sausage"" and found nothing so I thought I had a joke to share that no one here has posted. Obviously I was wrong about that. It has been posted, as ""Polish sausage"", but I still think it works just as well either way.

rayrj,"NASA's budget has dramatically increased by 1000 times it was last year.(non seirous duel party joke) ||| January 1st 2015

NASA and reasonable science enthusiasts has for decades been begging the capital hill for an increase in funds to do what they need to be able to do, and capital hill replied for decades ""We'll think about it."" Now it has happened at an unexpected rate. An earlier agreement that capital hill head among both parties was to fund various projects towards the development of the ""international space station"" for what is said to be for both scientific and diplomatic reasons.


When asking the two party representitives the following statements were made. The democratic party stated ""we hope that we can find a way to create a habitat planet for the humpback whales since the world will be uninhabitable by any living thing throughout the entire history of time since that one guy won't stop smoking, despite it adding calories when he does."" 
The conservative represented had this to say. ""We really hope that this new deal would be able to bring about diplomatic relations with the world's hippies and deadbeats for future lsnd, i mean money, I mean voters... favors? Yes favors, let's go with that."" When the president was asked about why he didn't veto the bill he said ""I understand how this is a huge concern among my fans er American people, and want to better reflect how I the popular, er president would be willing to accommodate. Perhaps we can use this to move towards a brighter future of political conduct such as how long, er any given president should be in term. Further.. huuuh... what does the prompter say it turned off. Oh there it goes. Further we want to make sure that everyone is as happy as they can be with our policies.


Certain items pertaining to the project funds were specified to be used including but not limited to: 
*moon dust converting to water
*targeting systems with several tetrameters of reach with accuracy
*moon dust converting to ""what whales breath if not water""
*machines to monitor money transactions on a global scale
*moon dust converting to ""what whales eat if not water""
*machines to scan people's voting records on a global scale to determine statistics and effect voting fraud.
and many more.

It's about time government realized that the NASA program needed to have a better budget, and I as I non inspecting reporter feel perfectly fine with the potential changes that can occur.

The mortician agrees and thanks the woman and the first woman leaves.  Now the second woman comes in and says, ""I know I've brought my husband wearing a black suit, but I've always really loved him in blue.  Is there any way you can have him in a blue suit for his funeral?""

The mortician assures her that it's not a problem and the second woman thanks her and leaves.  A few days later the mortician shows up at the first man's funeral and his widow walks up and says,
""Thank you so much for doing this.  My husband looks wonderful in the black suit you found him.""

The mortician replies, ""Of course, I was happy to do it. And here's your check back.""

""No, I really appreciate it and I want to pay you, just take whatever you need.""

His first wish is for unlimited food & drink. The spirit grants it and he is able to find food whenever he needs it.
His second wish is to be able to hear music whenever he wants. The spirit agrees and the air is filled with the sounds of whatever song the man wants to hear.
His third wish is for Angelina Jolie to be stranded on the island with him. The spirit grants his last wish and Angelina appears.

He gets to know Angelina well over the next few weeks and months. They eat and drink well, and listen to the most beautiful music day and night, in between session after session of the most amazing sex.

After a few weeks he begins to become depressed. Angelina tries her best to get to the cause of it but they can't figure it out. One night after roasting a pig on a spit, he turns to her and asks if he can try something. She agrees, so he dips his finger into the charcoal and draws a mustache on her. She is baffled but doesn't stop him. Then he draws a beard. She is thoroughly confused at this stage.

As you may know some of us have been known to have brushes with the authorities from time to time on the way home after a ""social session"" out with friends.

Well, two days ago I was out for an evening with friends and had several cocktails followed by some rather nice red wine.  Feeling jolly I still had the sense to know that I may be slightly over the limit.  That's when I did something that I've never done before - I took a cab home.  Sure enough on the way home there was a police road block, but since it was a cab they waved it past.  I arrived home safely without incident.

This was a real surprise as I had never driven a cab before.  I don't know where I got it and now that it's in my garage I don't know what to do with it",14,2015-01-02

When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.""
 
But the roaring flames held the firefighters off.
 
Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department who could bring out the company's secret files.
 
From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant.
 
Without even slowing down it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire fought it back on all sides.  It was a performance and effort never seen before.
 
Within a short time, the Norske old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.
 
The local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, ""What are you going to do with all that money?""

This request gets the attention of 3 knuckleheads at the other end of the bar. The bartender says (to himself), ""Who does this guy think he is?"", and serves him a glass of Scotch from the well. The customer takes a sip, and gives it back to the bartender, stating ""This is not even an aged Scotch. I want a 20 year old single malt Scotch. Impressed, the bartender takes down a bottle of 8 year old Scotch, pours a glass, and gives it to the customer. He takes a sip, and returns the glass, stating ""This is an 8 year old blended Scotch; I asked for a 20 year old single malt Scotch"". So, the bartender takes down a 15 year single malt Scotch, pours it out, and gives it to the customer. He takes a sip, correctly identifying the age, and returns it to the bartender, asking again for a 20 year old single malt Scotch. The bartender pours again, concealing the label from the customer, and, after taking a sip, the customer smiles and declares his drink a proper 20 year old single malt Scotch. And, in amazement, the bartender takes his hand from the bottle, and verifies that it is indeed what the customer ordered. One of the three drunks from the other end of the bar walks down with a glass, and asks the Scotch specialist to taste test it. He raises the glass to his lips, takes a sip and sprays it all over the bar, exclaiming ""This is piss!!!""  ""Yes ""says the drunk, ""but how old am I?""

cant_stop_dreaming,"An old man sees a younger one walking down the road with a roll of duct tape ||| In a small, backwoods town, an old codger is having his morning coffee out on his porch when he spies one of the boys from town walking down the road. He calls out to the young man.

“Hey, there, young fella. Whatcha doin’ walking around this neck of the woods this early in the morning?”

The young man holds up a roll of duct tape and calls back, “I’m going to catch some ducks!”

The older man just shakes his head at the foolishness of the young one, as he watches him stroll along into the woods. A few hours later, however, he shakes his head in wonderment as he sees the young man emerge from the woods, dragging a trail of ducks that have been caught in the tape. The young man smiles and waves as he walks by.

About a week later, the scene replays itself, except this other morning, the young man is carrying something larger. The older man calls out again, “Hey there, young fella, where are you off to today?”

This time, the young man holds up a roll of chicken wire and shouts, “I’m gonna catch me some chickens!”

Once again, the old codger shakes his head as he watches the younger man stroll into the woods. And, once again, he is shocked to see the kid walk back out of the woods a few hours later, dragging along a trail of chickens that have been caught in the wire.

Another week goes by and once again, the old man is having his coffee on his porch when he sees the younger one walking down the road with a bundle of something carried on his shoulder. This time, he calls out, “Hey, young fella, whatcha got there over your shoulder.”

The young man smiles and calls back, “These are a bunch of pussy willows!”

Don't ask why, you just are, and your Sergeant hates you) walking on a deserted street late at night.
Suddenly, an armed man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife and lunges at you.
You are carrying your truncheon and are an expert in using it.  However, you have only a split second to react before he reaches you.  What do you do?

ANSWER:

English  Police  Officer:

Firstly, the Officer must consider the man's human rights.

1) Does the man look poor or oppressed?

2) Has he newly arrived in this country and does not yet understand the law?

3) Is this really a knife or a ceremonial dagger?

4) Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?

5) Am I dressed provocatively?

6) Could I run away?

7) Could I possibly swing my truncheon and knock the knife out of his hand?

8) Should I try and negotiate with him to discuss his wrong-doings?

9)  Why am I carrying a truncheon anyway and what kind of message does this send to society?

10) Does he definitely want to kill me or would he be content just to wound me?

11) If I were to grab his knees and hold on, would he still want to stab and kill me?

12) If I raise my truncheon and he turns and runs away, do I get blamed if he falls over, knocks his head and kills himself?  

13) If I hurt him and lose the subsequent court case, does he have the opportunity to sue me, cost me my  job, my credibility and the loss of my family home?

A zoo's gorilla dies right before the zoo opens. It is the only gorilla at the zoo since they are not very profitable.

So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.
Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla. In about a month, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions den next to him. 
A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and horror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lions den. The man starts screaming ""HELP!! HELP!!!""

He says ""Alright guys I hate you died on Christmas Day, so to make up for it, I'll let you right in if you have anything on you that has any Christmas symbolism."" So the first man checks his pockets and pulls out a lighter. St. Peter asks, ""What is that supposed to symbolize?"" The 1st man replies, ""It's a Christmas candle."" St. Peter acknowledges it and let's him through. The second man sweats a little as he searches his pockets and says, ""oh here we have it, my keys, they jingle just like Christmas bells."" So St. Peter waves him through. The last guy stumbles up still a little more sauced than he should be, and begins to check his pockets. He searches his coat pockets and begins to sober up as he panics thinking he doesn't have anything. St. Peter asks him impatiently if he has any sort of Christmas symbolism. Then the man smiles and says,""oh wait."" He reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a pair of red women's underwear. At this St. Peter scoffs and says, ""how is this a Christmas symbol?"" The third man replies, ""because they're Carol's.""",37,2015-01-03

I introduced myself to her and we got to talking. She immediately friend zoned me. I'm hurt, but I'm like, whatever. She's amazing and man, if not today, then maybe tomorrow she'll change her mind. Until this asshole came along. 

He was one of the main people bullying me, and she decided to hook up with that asshole. I was really hurt, friend. Not going to lie. My pride was hurt. The entire time I was thinking, “Maybe it's a phase. She'll wake up one day and realize the guy she's with is a total douchebag.” But no. We grow up, and wouldn't you believe it? The girl MARRIES that guy. They have a kid and everything. Unbelievable.

I was in complete shock. I still liked this girl, and he clearly had no class, but my hands were tied. But there was a group of people I knew who really didn't like him. So I said, “Fuck it. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” I began to hang out with this group. Until the leader did something completely unacceptable.

He tried to kill the girl, her stupid husband, AND the baby. Somehow the child lived, but damn. That was really messed up. Anyway, after all of that stuff happened, I just moved on and became the Potions Master at Hogwarts. I still look after that child, though.",51,2015-01-03

Suddenly, the Prime Minister of Canada walks up to them with a huge smile on his face and says, ""Hey Dave! Long time no see!"" Mike is in shock and just listens to Dave and the PM chat, laugh and act lie they're old friends. After a bit, the PM says goodbye and walks off.

""You know the Prime Minister!?"" Mike asks. ""Of course,"" says Dave, ""We've been friends for forever."" So Mike asks him questions about it, like where they met, how they met, etc. While Mike is questioning Dave, lo and behold, the President of the United States walks up to them. ""Dave! Holy moley! How you've been, man? Great to see you! When you coming by the White House again?"" Mike's jaw drops. Once again, he listens to the POTUS and Dave chat and laugh. POTUS fist pounds Dave, says goodbye, and walks off.

""You know the President!?"" Mike asks in total disbelief. ""Of course,"" Dave answers, ""I never told you that?"" So of course, Mike starts questioning Dave about it. How did they meet, where, when, etc. Suddenly, Dave apologizes and says, ""Mike, it's been good hanging out and everything but I gotta run. I've been invited by the pope to go hang out in the Vatican."" Mike is understandably confused and doubtful.

""Ok, I can accept that you know both the president and the PM, but there's no way you know the Pope. That's impossible,"" Mike says. ""It's true. We're old friends. In fact, I'll prove it. I'm allowed to bring a friend to Italy with me. Come along and I'll show you.""

So Mike and Dave head over to Vatican City and Dave tells Mike to wait in the crowd in St. Peter's Square while the Pope does the Angelus prayer, the prayer he does every sunday at noon from his balcony. So Mike waits and keeps checking his watch, but begins to wonder where Dave went. Suddenly, chimes start ringing. 12 rings later, it's noon, and out steps the Pope, and would you believe that, to his side, is Dave! Mike nearly faints. The crowd is going crazy. Suddenly, a stranger grabs Mike, and says, ""Oh Jesus. I can't believe it! It''s really him! But, who's that guy standing next to Dave?""",10,2015-01-03

The three guys look at each other and wonder how hard that could be. They all agreed and the gates opened. The buddies look out and see the whole place is just swarming with ducks. They took some steps in making sure they don't step on any ducks. A few days pass when BAM the first guy steps on a duck. God soon appears with the most ugliest women the guy had ever seen. God says ""Because you stepped on a duck you will now be chained to the ugliest woman in heaven for the rest of your time here."" God snaps his finger and the first guy and woman, chained together, vanish. The other two buddies make a pact to look out for each other to make sure they don't suffer the same fate.

Years go by and the two buddies have been incredibly careful. They watched wherever they stepped. However, one morning one of the buddies steps out of bed...right onto a duck. BAM, God appears with the most wretched, horse faced, mole bearing woman the two buddies had ever seen. God snapped his fingers and they both vanished.

Finally, the last buddy who had been careful for years is the only one left. He continues walking around his duck filled palace being incredibly careful. Decades go by and he is still hanging in there when suddenly BAM God appears. 

""But, I never stepped on a duck,"" the young man stammered.

God doesn't say anything, but snaps his fingers. Soon the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen appeared by his side. God left without ever speaking a word.

The man asked the woman what happened.

""I don't know what happened to you, but I stepped on a duck."" She replied",5,2015-01-03

At the end of the branch it hesitates for a minute before jumping off flailing its legs wildly tumbling end over end before smashing head first into the ground.

Slightly dazed the turtle gets up and starts climbing the tree again. This time the turtle passes the first branch, and starts crawling along a higher, less sturdy branch. Once again he reaches the end, hesitates, and then jumps off flailing wildly and end over end until he smashes head first into the ground.

This time the turtle seems clearly shaken up, but resolutely starts climbing the tree again. He bypasses both the first and second branch and climbs out the highest, most shaky branch. This time when he reaches the end of the branch he looks over and waves at two birds watching him.

A telemarketer calls a house and a little girl answers the phone:

Little girl (LG): \*quiet voice* *""Hello?""*

Telemarketer (TM) ""Hello there and good day, would you mother be available to talk to?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""No, she's busy at the moment.*""

TM: ""Oh, okay, would your father be there at all?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""No, he's busy at the moment as well.""*

TM: ""Right, is there someone else over the age of 18 there?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""There's my uncle...""*

TM: ""Oh? Can I speak to your uncle please?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""No, he's busy at the moment.*

TM: ""Well then, who else is there right now?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""My aunt is here too.""*

TM: ""Great, can you put your aunt on the phone then?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""I'm sorry, she's busy at the moment.""*

TM: ""Well then, who else is in the house?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""There's our next door neighbour""*

TM: Right, I'll have a chat to him if you don't mind?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""He's busy right now too.""*

The telemarketer is starting to get a little frustrated, he's had a shit day, hasn't made any sales, and he's keen to get get one on the board before he goes home, so he asks the little girl:

TM: ""Are the any other adults there?""

(LG) \*quiet voice* *""There's a policeman, a fireman, and there's a priest""*

Unable to contain it any longer, the telemarketer's curiosity and frustration get the better of him:

TM: ""What the *hell* are all those people doing at your house, and why are they all too busy to talk to me right now!?

Last weekend, I took Cook along to go to bank. While I was waiting in the hall, Cook woofed. I took out the newspaper I just bought and spread all of them on the floor at the corner. After a while, I picked up the paper and folded up carefully. I pushed the door open and went out to the street, looking for a garbage can. Suddenly, a motorcycle was passing me with an engine roaring. The rider on the back seat wearing a black jack and a large sunglasses seized the newspaper bag and took it away rapidly. Before I was aware of what happened, the motorcycle ran away. I was stunned completely and didn't know what I should do.

 ""Have you been in the Far East recently, within the last year or so?"" ""Why, yes,"" replied the man. 
""And did you have sex while over there?"" 
The man looked worried. ""Well, yes, once or twice."" 
The doctor's face got a grave expression on it. ""That's what I was afraid of. You have a new disease that's just starting to spread in this country. It's called 'Hong Kong Dong.'"" 
The man gulped. ""What do you do for it? Is there a cure?""
 ""Well, sort of. You see, there is no way to cure the disease, but you must have an operation.""
 ""An operation? What kind of operation?"" ""We cut off your penis."" ""Wow! Do you mind if I get a second opinion?"" 
The doctor replied, ""Of course not. In something of such a serious nature as this, I think you should get a second and a third opinion!"" The man consulted a urologist who told him essentially the same story, diagnosis, prognosis, and recommended treatment. He was understandably upset, so he asked the second doctor to recommend another doctor for his third opinion. The urologist suggested that, since this disease originated in the Far East that he travel there, as the Asian doctors might know more about it. Mr. Unlucky promptly booked passage on an airline for Hong Kong, where he received an immediate consultation with that Crown Colony's most eminent physician. After a series of tests, he awaited the verdict. The doctor entered the examining room.
 ""Well, is it Hong Kong Dong?"" he inquired, unable to wait.
 ""Yes.""
 ""And is it really incurable?""
 ""Yes, there is no known cure."" 
The man's face crumpled as he fought back tears. ""And am I going to have an operation? Will they have to cut off my penis?"" 
At that the man was astonished to see the doctor break into laughter. ""What's so funny, Doc? You mean I don't have to have surgery?"" 
As the doctor regained control of himself, he managed to choke out, ""Oh, those American doctors! Cut, clamp, sew! Surgery, surgery, all they can think of is surgery!""
 ""I don't have to have my penis cut off?"" The man was overjoyed.

""You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates these serious headaches you've been experiencing. So the only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" 

Jerry was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. 

When he eventually left the hospital Jerry was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt not to have a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he also knew that he was missing an important part of himself. 

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a fresh start and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and thought to himself a new suit would be the perfect thing to mark this new beginning. 

He entered the shop and told the salesman: ""I'd like a new suit."" 
The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said: ""Let's see... size 44 long?"" 
""That's right, how did you know?"" said Jerry, laughing. 

""I've been in the business 60 years!"" replied the tailor. 

Jerry tried on the suit and it fitted like a glove. As Jerry admired himself in the mirror, the salesman 
asked: ""How about a new shirt?"" 

Jerry thought for a moment and then agreed. 
The salesman eyed Jerry again. 

""Let's see... 34 sleeve and 16-and-a-half neck?"" 

Once again, Jerry was surprised. 
""That's right, how did you know?"" 

""Like I said, I've been in the business 60 years!"" 

So Jerry tried on the shirt, and it was a perfect fit. As Jerry adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked: ""How about new shoes?"" Jerry was on a roll and so thought, why not? 
So the salesman eyed Jerry's feet and said: ""Let's see... you must be a size nine-and-a-half?"" 

Jerry was astonished. ""That's right, how did you know?"" 
""Well, young fella, I've been in the business long enough to know these things!"" 

Jerry tried on the shoes and they were also a remarkable fit. Jerry walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked: ""So that only leaves the new underwear. How about it?"" 

Jerry thought for a second and agreed. 
The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said: ""Let's see... size 36."" 

Jerry laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" 
The salesman shook his head. ""There's no way. I'm never wrong. You can't wear a size 34."" 

""Oh yes I can,"" replied Jerry and have been most of my life. 
""I don't understand,"" said the tailor. ""By my reckoning a 34 underwear would press your testicles up 
against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.""",314,2015-01-04

thevraptor,"The love story of 6 and 9 ||| Sit children, and let me tell you the tale of a guy who was caught in a predicament.

One day a guy was mowing his lawn. He was about a 6, so let's call him that. 6 was mowing his lawn until a dog came running down the street. 6 chased the dog until he caught him. He turned around and saw that a beautiful girl had been chasing the dog too. She was a 9, so lets call her 9. 9 thanked 6 for getting her dog. 6 asked for her number. His palms sweat while 9 made her decision. Success!

6 and 9 started going on dates. Before they knew it, they were in a relationship.

Fast forward a little bit, and in enters 7. 7 is another girl that 6 meets, and she is a 7, so that's why we will call her 7.

6 and 7 start hanging out. 6 thinks that they are just friends, but 7 is romantically interested. One day, 6 introduces 9 to 7. 7 gets extremely jealous and starts being very passive aggressive to 9.

A couple weeks later, 9 tells 6 that 7 had been sending her death threats over FaceBook. She asked 6 to make her stop, and 6 did send her messages over FB, asking her to stop, but 7 didn't reply.

4 weeks later, 6 hasn't heard from either 9 nor 7 over facebook, and he starts to get worried. He is pacing the floor when suddenly, a knock comes at the door. He opens it and waiting for him is a police officer. Officer holds up a picture of 9 and asks, ""Is this your girlfriend?""

""Yes,"" 6 replies. His palms start to get sweaty, sweaty like they did a month or two ago when he asked for 9's number, but it didn't feel the same.

The officer proceeds to say that 7 had committed suicide in her room an that they found remains of 9 in her stomach during the autopsy.

Why was the 6 afraid of the 7?",44,2015-01-05

According to eye witnesses, it happened so quickly the poor woman didn’t have a fighting chance. Multiples pieces of Mongolian beef lunged at the woman, knocking her off her chair. She tried to get up but the beef was to strong. Her husband and some other bystanders tried to knock the beef off of her, but it was to quick and evaded them. The husband was only able to grab a single piece of beef and smash it with a plate, before zombie beef still in serving trays, started to re-animate. Then the shock and awe turned into complete pandemonium. The Mongolian beef swarmed out of the serving trays and started wriggling their way towards the already incapacitated lady. Some beef pieces grabbed plastic knifes as they left the buffet area, and when they reached the woman, they started sawing off the woman’s feet. But that wasn't the cause of death the autopsy report says. The cause of death was asphyxiation. Over seventy five pieces of Mongolian beef had forced their way down the woman's throat.

""Excuse me lads,"" said the Race Dog. ""I couldn't help but over hear your conversation and I wanted to let you know that that very same thing happened to me about a week ago down at the track. I was running a race and struggling on the outside lane trying to get some space when I started to drift further back and away from the lead. I knew I was going to lose that race but then that very strange light that you boys had just described started pulsing from the stands. Well, as you may have already guessed, 'Woosh,' there I was up at the front and I ended up winning that race although I've never been able to figure out exactly how.""

The bartender looks bewildered, so the man explains, “I stuff and mount dead animals.” And the bartender stands back and hollers to the whole bar full of hilbillies, “It’s OK, boys! He’s one of us!”

So the man gets comfortable and sips his cocktail. And by and by he becomes peckish, and asks the bartender for a bite to eat. All the bartender can offer him is pork rinds, so that’ll have to do. So the man chomps down on those salty, crunchy pork rinds. And he likes them. In fact, he likes them so much that he gets a pork rind lodged in his throat. After a minute or so he is in real distress. So one of the barflies walks up to him and says, “Kin ya swallar?” The man shakes his head. And the hillbilly follows up, “Kin ya breathe?” The man shakes his head as he begins to turn blue. And the hillbilly reaches around the man’s waist, unbuckles his belt, drops his breeches, yanks down his briefs, and sticks his tongue up his ass crack. The man is so shocked that he has a violent spasm, which causes the pork rind to fly out of his mouth. As he begins to breathe again, he struggles to express his gratitude to the good Samaritan. And the hillbilly goes, “Hit don’t mean doodley squat. Ackshly, I’m much obliged to ye.

The boy is satisfied and hands over the duck, but the prostitute is still not satisfied and agrees to give back the duck for some more sex.

allenflame,"New Farmer ||| A City slicker decided after working at a desk job in the cities for 30 years that he wanted to retire to the country and have a hobby farm.

He bought a nice 10 acre hobby farm, moved his family and possetions into the house and was very pleased. Now he needed to get some farm animals.

He was new to this, so he decided to walk down the long gravel road to visit his neihbors who were all farmers and see if he could purchas a few animals to get him started.

He came to the first farm on his left, walked up the dirt driveway and greeted the farmer. He told him he wanted to buy a rabbit. The farmer looked at hime and replied ""Around here we don't call them rabbits, we call them Peter cotton tails"" or you can just call them a ""Peter"" for short.

He thanked him for letting him know and then said he wanted to buy a Peter if the farmer had one he could sell him. The farmer said he would be more than glad to sell him one, stuck a deal, and the city slicker continued down the gravel road on to another farm with his rabbit under one arm.

The city slicker comes to the next farm, walks up the dirt driveway again, looks around for the farmer, then tells him he is looking to purchase a hen. The farmer replied ""Around here we don't call them hens, we call them pullets"".

The city slicker thanked the farmer, then said he would like to purchase a pullet if he could from the farmer. The farmer said he has plenty to spare and would be glad to sell him one.

They struck a deal and the city slicker was on his way again down the gravel road, now with one peter and one pullet under each arm.

He reached the last farm on the end of the road, walked up to the farmer and told him he was interested in purchasing a mule, and asked if he had one he could sell. The farmer replied ""Around here we don't call them mules, we call them Ass's"".

Again, the city slicker thanked the farmer and said he would like to purchase an Ass if he had one he could spare.

The farmer said he had only one he could spare, and that is was a hard working Ass, but he did have a catch. The city slicker was a little concerned and asked what was wrong with the Ass. The farmer said the mule will be working and pulling nice and hard, and then suddenly stop dead in his tracks, BUT all you had to do was scratch him behind his ear, and he would go right back to work.

The city slicker thought that was no real big deal and that he could easily handle that. So city slicker struck up a deal with the farmer and decided to head home with a cock under his right arm, a pullet under his left arm, and the Ass walking beside him.

He was almost home when the Ass stopped dead in his tracks right in front of a lady working in her flower garden along the road.

The city slicker looked a little distressed, so the lady asked if she could help him. He replied.......""Could you hold my peter and pullet while I scratch my Ass?"" ",0,2015-01-05

The Taxman decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the Tax office.

The taxman was not surprised when Grandpa showed up with his accountant.

The taxman said, 'Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I'm not sure the tax office finds that believable.'

'I'm a great gambler, and I can prove it,' says Grandpa. 'How about a demonstration?'

The taxman thinks for a moment and said, 'Okay. Go ahead.'

Grandpa says, 'I'll bet you a thousand pounds that I can bite my own eye.'

The taxman thinks a moment and says, 'It's a bet.'

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The taxman's jaw drops.

Grandpa says, 'Now, I'll bet you two thousand pounds that I can bite my other eye.'

Now the taxman can tell Grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his false teeth and bites his good eye.

The stunned taxman now realises he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa's accountant as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

'Want to go double or nothing?', Grandpa asks? 'I'll bet you six thousand pounds that I can stand on this side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.'

The taxman, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old man could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much pees all over the taxman's desk.

The taxman leaps with joy, realising that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa's own accountant moans and puts his head in his hands.

'Are you okay?', the taxman asks.

'Not really,' says the accountant. 'This morning, when Grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand pounds that he could come in here and piss all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!'

They decide that it would be symbolic to have their funeral together, because they were so close through life that they would like their lives to be celebrated together in death.

The pallbearers bring out a single coffin, to which the families are confused.

The funeral director asks the eulogist why there's only one casket, he informs them that because of the sudden amount of casualties in a small fishing town it was all they were able to build so quickly. ""Not to worry, because they have everyone covered with this one.""

The family absolutely loses it upon hearing this news. The tears turn to anger and in a rampaging outburst they trample the eulogist to death.

And then the fight started…My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary. She said, ""I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 150 in about 3 seconds.""I bought her a scale.And then the fight started…

When I got home last night, my wife demanded that I take her someplace expensive… so, I took her to a gas station.And then the fight started…

I took my wife to a restaurant. The waiter, for some reason, took my order first.""I’ll have the strip steak, medium rare, please.""He asked, ""Aren’t you worried about the mad cow?""""Nah, she can order for herself.""And then the fight started…

I asked my wife, ""Where do you want to go for our anniversary? ""It warmed my heart to see her face melt in sweet appreciation.""Somewhere I haven’t been in a long time!"" she said.So I suggested, ""How about the kitchen?""And that’s when the fight started…

A little while later a bear came out of the tree line on the other side of the river. The hunter pulled up his gun and put the sights on the bear. Just as he did this a really large water fly started hovering in his line of sight. He thought angrily to himself that fly better drop out of sight quick.

As this occurred there was a mouse eye balling the hunters lunch. The mouse said to itself, if that fly just dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, would jump in his boat, and forget his lunch.

Simultaneously, a hawk was watching the mouse from a tree high above. The hawk said to itself, if the fly dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, jump in his boat, forget his lunch, and the mouse will come out from undercover.

Also, while this was occurring, a bobcat was monitoring the same situation. The bobcat said to itself that if the fly dropped 6in the hunter would get a shot, jump in his boat, forget his lunch, and the mouse will come out from undercover.

Well, the fly finally dropped 6in and the hunter took his shot, jumped in the boat, and forgot his lunch. Once the shore was clear the mouse charged the lunch, the hawk swooped, and as the cat pounced the hawk swiped the mouse, and the Bob cat flew into the river.

The moral of the story is, when the fly drops 6in the pussy gets wet.

loopmoploop,"Once upon a time, there was an Egyptian named Benny ||| One day, Benny was strolling along the banks of the Nile, minding his own business. However, he came across an urn, buried in the sand. The urn was all dusty and dented and cracked and bent and generally broken. But Benny thought, hey, I can probably get a few coins from this, so he rubbed the urn on his sleeve. But suddenly, out of the urn came a genie!

The genie stretched and yawned and said: ""Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't tell you how long I've been in that urn! You're a lucky man, fella. Very lucky.""

""Why?"" said Benny.

""Because you've got wishes coming your way, friend. Three, to be exact.""

So Benny thought for a while and said, ""Ok, I want some new threads."" And he got a spiffy new toga. And then he said ""I could use a new house."" And his little mud hut turned into a fabulous marble mansion.

Finally, Benny said: ""And, for my final wish, I'd like to be immortal. I wanna live forever.""

The genie was taken back a bit and thought for a while: ""Well, that's, um, that's a bit of an expensive wish, you see. Hm. Tell you what. I'll make you immortal, but on one condition. You can never, ever, shave your beard or cut your hair. If you do, you're gonna get sucked into an urn, like me. Deal?""

""Deal,"" said Benny.

So the genie granted his wish and flew off into the Sahara. Benny began wandering the world, and he saw Rome rise and fall, the Dark Ages get lighter, the New World grow and prosper. He went all over the planet, from north to south to east to west. But all this time, Benny had never fallen in love.

But one day, Benny was walking along a beach, and he spotted a beautiful woman. He walked up to her and introduced himself. And as the woman brushed the hair out of his face they gazed into each other's eyes, and it was love at first sight. They danced and they laughed and they sung, and it was a happy time for both of them.

One day, on the same beach they had met on, Benny got down on one knee and asked the woman to marry him. The woman thought for a while.

""Benny,"" she said, ""I'll marry you. But only if you shave your beard and cut your hair. It's long and dirty and full of rats, and whenever we go to see a movie it takes up the entire aisle. I just can't live with it.""

Benny sat down and mulled this over. The Genie and the urn were long gone, he thought, and besides, he loved this girl, and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. He happily agreed, and went to the pharmacy and bought about 500 cans of shaving cream and 200 disposable razors.

When he got back to his apartment, he gave his girlfriend a kiss and went into the bathroom and shut the door. You could hear the *chic, chic* of the razor and the *pst, pst* of the shaving cream. But then, suddenly, it all went quiet.

At first, his girlfriend thought, well, ok, maybe he's just taking his time, but eventually she started to get concerned, and after a while, she knocked on the door. 

""Benny?""

She knocked again, louder.

""Benny?""

She knocked once more, even louder.

""BENNY?""

Finally she pushed open the door, and on the ground lay around 50 cubic meters of hair, and an urn.

So, there's a moral to this story.

And that moral is, that a Benny shaved, is a Benny urned.",14,2015-01-07

VelociSaurusRaptor,"Paddy Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman are all waiting for their job interview. ||| Paddy Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman are all sitting in the waiting room; patiently waiting to be called in for their job interview.

Paddy Englishman is the first to be called in.
The first thing Paddy Englishman notices is that the Manager has one ear at the top of his head and the other is at the bottom. 

The interview is going well when the Manager asks, ""So, before you go is there anything strange you notice about me?""

Paddy Englishman replies, ""Well, your ears are a bit wonky!"" The manager tells Paddy Englishman he hasn't got the job and needs to go back to the waiting area. 

Paddy Englishman walks out and says to the other two, ""Try not to mention the Managers ears, he's awful sensitive about them.""


Paddy Scotsman is up next.
As soon as he walks in he just starts laughing! The Manager asks what he finds so funny?
Paddy Scotsman replies, ""Look at the state of your fuckin' ears pal"", and laughs himself out the door. 


Paddy Scotsman warns Paddy Irishman, ""Whatever you do don't bring up his ears!""

With Paddy Englishman and Scotsman's advice' Paddy Irishman is confident he'll get the job. He gets called into the office.

The interview isn't going too bad then the Manager asks, ""Before you leave; using your observational skills, is there anything different you can tell about me?' 

Paddy Irishman studies him for a bit, ""I believe you're wearing Contact Lenses.""

""Well done, you've got the job. You're just the type of person we've been looking for!"" 
Paddy Irishman shakes the Managers hand and gets up to leave. Just as he gets to the door the Manager stops him and asks,""Paddy, if you don't mind me asking, how did you know I was wearing contact lenses?"" 

Paddy Irishman turns around, ""Well, you'll not get a pair of glasses with ears like that you stupid lookin' cunt!""

So, the father goes in and he says to his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want one green golf ball.""  The father things green golf ball but he doesn't have time to really ask about it.  He rushes out to the nearest store and gets his son one green golf ball.  He takes it back to the hospital where he places it next to his son's bed.  The next morning the boy is alive and well.  The doctor releases him and he goes home.  A number of years have passed now.  The son is about to go to college.  A very nice university actually, lots of activities, girls, and even a few guys for a possible experimentation phase but I digress. He is moving into this dorm room when his parents sit him down and tell him how proud him they are and now that he won't be home as much they don't feel they can live together and they will be getting a divorce.  The son says he understands and all go home to finish getting his stuff for his room.  The next day the son is sick and they rush him to the hospital.  The doctor says to the parents, ""We've run all the tests and we are afraid your son will not make it.""  The father goes and asks the son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want a bucket full of green golf balls.""  The dad thinks to himself, ""Those damn green golf balls again."" But he doesn't think anything more of it.  He rushes out to the nearest sporting store and purchases a bucket and fills it up with green golf balls.  He hurries back to the hospital where he places the bucket next to his son's bed.  The next day the boy is alive and well, then shortly released and goes back to college.  He works very hard during his time there and decides to go into Law.  He is now working as an intern at a prestigous law office in downtown Chicago,  His parents come to visit him one weekend where he shows them the great work he is doing and how close he is to becoming a lawyer.  After all this his parents set him down and explain to him how they have been living all these years in misery and how they must get this divorce.  The son says he understands and they go back to his apartment.  The next day the boy is very sick and he is rushed to the hospital.  The doctor is reviewing his charts and the new tests and said to the parents, ""I'm afraid there is nothing we can do for you son, he is going to die.""  The father goes in and asks his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son's responese, ""I want I wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.""  The father rushes out and gets for his son this wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.  He rolls up next to the bed and the next day the son is alive and well.  He goes home and continues his work as an attorney.  During this time he meets a beautiful young woman who he decides that he will marry.  On the night of the rehearsal dinner everything is perfect. His parents come up to him and father says, ""I see how much you love your fiance and those words mean so much to your mother and me. However, we no longer feel that way towards one another and we are going to get divorced."" The son tells his parents that he understands and they go back to the hotel rooms.  Overnight the son becomes very sick.  They rush him to the hospital where the doctor comes up to the family and expresses his opinion and sorrow for their son's condition.  He tells them he doesn't feel he will make it this time.  The father goes into the room and asks his son, ""What can I get you befor you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want one truckload of green golf balls."" The father asks his friend to borrow his pick up truck and rushes out and fills it to the brim with green golf balls.  He parks outside the window where his son can see the truck and its load of green golf balls.  The son looks out his window and lays back down.  The next day the son is well and alive and the wedding goes on.  Years have passed, the son has children, and the parents are in their twilight years.  They come to visit their son and grandchildren.  While on the porch the father says to the son, ""You have a wonderful life with your own family and career now.  Your mother and I aren't going to be around much longer and we don't want to live our lives in misery. We MUST get divorced so we can be happy in these remaining years.""  The son says he understands and they all go in and head to bed.  The next day the son is very ill.  He is rushed to the hospital.  The doctor reviews all his records from the first incident to the last and says to the family, ""I'm sorry but he isn't going to make it.  I don't care how many green golf balls this man gets.""  So, the father goes and says to his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son responds with, ""I want two truck loads of  green golf balls.""  The father rushes out and rents to huge semis and fills them both with green golf balls from the tri-state area.  He brings the trucks back to the hospital where he parks them for the son to see.  He raises his head and lays back down. The next day the son is no better.  Everyone is crying and the father goes and asks his son, ""Before you go I need to know why all these years did you want green golf balls?""  The son raises his head and says to his father,""Because, because, because....."" and then he dies.  --- You have now read the green golf ball joke and your time doing so belongs to me!! ",2,2015-01-07

There is a terrible accident and 100 couples were killed. They find themselves in front of St. Peter and the Pearly Gates. St. Peter decides to divide the group into two and declares: ""Every man who wore the pants in the relationship stand on the left line, and all the men who let their women boss you around stand on the right."" Much to his surprise, 99 men stand on the right. St. Peter is very stunned and curious about the sole man standing on the left. He goes up to him and asks, ""okay son, why are you in this line?""

As since all the universe is in motion in the grand ballet of planetary motions—of which Earth is but one humble rock—position is a very tenuous thing.  

“Also, logic following, if you could know my position, I wouldn’t therefore, have tangible, measurable momentum.
 
“Alas, officer,"" I continued, ""my position *might have been* the 35-mph zone, but if you could know that with certainty, you couldn’t know my momentum, my speed.”  I smiled then.  “Therefore, you must let me go.”

One day a new face was hired to work along with me, named Joe. In my tiny town where the residence new each other, I can proudly say I've never seen this man before in my life.

The man was popular with the ladies. Even got a few girls to fool around with him behind their husbands and daddies backs. Sure as hell ain't introducing *him* to my girl.

Time passes and my girl says she's pregnant. My goodness was I both overjoyed and anxious for the future. And by tradition, I gotta make a modest woman of this fine young lady! Only problem was, since then she had this lingering darkness to her and this raised some concerns. One morning before work I question her on this and she breaks into tears. She met Joe and the child is likely his! She no longer feels like she could be with me after her affair. I demanded she leave my house and never return. In a rage I grabbed my shotgun and stormed to the oilfield in hopes of finding Joe there.

I see him and I hit his face with the butt of my gun with all my force. Before I could pull the trigger on this womanizer I was apprehended by my coworkers. Joe's eye was swollen like a boll of cotton. He ran away and I never heard from him again..... months later my brother visited me and asked why I've been so depressed. I tell him,

He was always tired and sat on the couch watching tv.  He was not interested in having sex, doing yard work or much of anything.  
  
She made an appointment for him to see a doctor.  In talking with the doctor, he is told that a much needed vacation is in order.  To go home and have his wife leave for a week and then come back.  That should give him all the alone time he needs to get back on track.  The man is excited and goes home to tell her the news.

  She is willing to do whatever, so she packs a bag amidst him telling her to “hurry the hell up and get out!”  She quickly explains that she has made all of his meals and they are labeled in the refrigerator.  The dog food is also in the refrigerator and not to forget to feed the dog.  The man is in such a hurry doesn’t listen and rushes her along.
  
  Soon after she is gone he gets hungry.  He goes to the fridge find some hamburger patties wrapped up ready to fry and makes him a hamburger.  Shortly after he starts to feel great, he cleans the whole house, the yard and works on several projects around the house.  He just can’t seem to eat enough of those hamburgers.  

  By weeks end she returns to find the house immaculate, the yard maintained and all of her projects done.  She asks him what has happened and he throws her on the bed and makes mad passionately love to her.  She is so swept away and in awe she can hardly contain herself.  He tells her about how the burgers she left for him made him a changed man.  

   She doesn’t understand and tells him that she left no burgers for him.  She goes to the fridge to find that all of the Gaines burger dog food is gone.  She tells him that he’s been eating dog food.  The man doesn’t care and continues to eat them.  

   She calls the doctor and explains what is going on.  The doctor reassures her that if it has changed him and she likes it, not to worry about it.  The dog food won’t hurt him.  

   Two weeks later the woman calls the doctor again crying and sobbing, tells the doctor that her husband died.  The doctor said he cannot believe the man died from eating dog food?  She exclaims “no he was in the middle of the road licking his dick and a truck ran him over!”

^^[listen.to.it.here](http://vimeo.com/109935412)

There was a poor dirt farming family in Ireland. All they had was this one milk cow. The would turn the milk to cheese and sell at the market to buy food.

Well, one morning, the father wakes up and sees the milk cow dead. So he hangs himself in the tree.

The mother wakes up, sees the milk cow dead and her husband hanging from the tree and throws herself into the river and she washes up on the shore.

The oldest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanged and, by his mother who has washed up on the shore, a leprechaun - a female leprechaun.

She says "" Looks like you're having a bad day"". he say ""I should say so."" She says ""i'll make you a deal, if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring your mom and dad back, and even the milk cow"".

He says ""why not?"". He almost makes it but fails, so she kills him.

The next son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, his father hanging and his mother and brother dead by the shore near the leprechaun.

She tells him ""if you make love to me 10 times in a row, I'll bring you father, mother and brother back, and also the milk cow"". He agrees. He doesn't make it either, so the leprechaun kills him.

The youngest son wakes up, sees the milk cow dead, the father hanging from the tree, and his mother and two brothers dead by the shore, and the female leprechaun.

She tells him ""if you make love to me 10 times in a row, without stopping, I'll bring your father, mother and two brothers back, and even the milk cow"".

He says ""Well, look at you and look at me, I'm young and virile, let's try it. BUT, what if I make love to you 15 times in a row?""

She says, ""In that case, I'll bring your father, mother and brothers back, even the milk cow and give you nice mansion where your hovel is"".

He says ""That's fine and all, but what if I make love to you 20 times in a row?""

She says ""If you make love to me 20 times in a row, I'll bring your entire family back, even the milk cow, give you mansion where your hovel is and give you a big pot of gold and you'll be set for life"".

He says ""alright let's get started in a minute, but first, if I make love to you 20 times in a row, what's to stop YOU from dying? The milk cow did.""

baconbiscuitbadger,"honest old lady...... ||| In a trial, a small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to 
the stand. The witness was grand motherly, elderly woman. He approached her and asked, ""Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"" She responded, ""Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a young boy and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you!"" 


The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, ""Mrs. Jones. Do you know the defence attorney?"" She again replied, ""Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women, one of them was your wife. Yes, I know him!"" The defence attorney almost died.


The judge asked both counsellors to approach the bench, and in a very quiet voice, said, ""If either of you bastards asks her if she knows me, I'll throw you in jail for contempt!""

12.Children, remember when our Lord, Christ, hung on the cross, looking down toward his disciples and saw even Peter, who had denied him. 

13. ""Peter,"" spake the Lord.

14. Peter heard his Lord speak his name, but no more, so he quickly tried to climb up and hear if Jesus had any last words. 15. Yet in his haste he slipped and fell and sprained his right knee, even as Jesus had said that morning, 16.""You need to be careful, Peter, or you will sprain your knee one day.""

17. ""Peter,"" spake the Lord again.

18. Then did Peter resolve to hear his Lord's voice. 19. He reached for and climbed the cross, only to lose his grip and fall again, breaking the bones in his left hand.

20. ""Peter,"" Jesus said one last time, and his voice was fraught with death.""

21. At this, Peter found himself imbued with the Holy Spirit, and thus did he climb. 22. Reaching the apex of the cross, he wrapped himself onto it and touched Jesus' face.

23. ""My Lord! It is I!"" spake Peter. ""Peter, your servant.""

So one day an old nun and young nun decide to ride their bikes into the city to pick up supplies for that night’s dinner. On their ride into the city, they take the short road. They get into the city do, their shopping, and return home by the same route. They do this every night for the next week. One night, however, the old nun says, “Sister, let’s take the scenic route home tonight. I think you’ll really enjoy it.”

So that night, after their shopping, the nuns ride their bikes home via the scenic route. It’s a beautiful ride, with rolling hills and a wonderful view of the sunset. However, during the ride, the younger nun began to make noises.

“Oh,” she said, quietly at first, and then louder and louder. “Oh! Ooh!” The older nun finally took notice. She looked back, winked, and said to the younger nun as they bounced over the cobblestone road, “So you like this road, huh?” to which the younger nun replies, “Yeah -- oh! -- I’ve never come this way before!”",128,2015-01-08
